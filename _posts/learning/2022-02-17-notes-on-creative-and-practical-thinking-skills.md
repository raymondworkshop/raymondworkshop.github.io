#### Notes

-   separate the processes of creation from improving

    -   creation is about building

        -   维持创造者思维，专注于 **将脑中的想法转变为可工作的最小实现**的过程
        -   MVP - 顺应自身当前的代码素养，不额外付出打磨的精力

    -   Improving is refactoring and algorithms

        -   再重构和优化，提升工程能力

    -   you cann't write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time
        -   while you invent, don't select. while you sketch, don't inspect.
            while you write the first draft, don't reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.

#### How to think clearly

-   TODO

-   The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers.

    -   **They understand the basics at a very fundamental level**
    -   **Fundamentals are key to understanding how things work**, and **most high performers have the fundamentals down in their respective disciplines**.  
        It could be in science, music, architecture or anything.
    -   I would rather **understand the basics really well** than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts
        -   I can't stitch together and can't retrive from the basics.

            -   "**My heart tells me that** ..."
        -   find a quiet place **where you can let your emotions and thoughts flow freely**

    -   listen to your heart, **don't trust it automatically**
        -   sometimes it's wrong

-   **Use your values within your rational thought process**

    -   **Gain as much information as you can about choices**

        -   what is **the probable benefit** of a decision? will it be something you'll **ever regret**? your rational mind and heart may be giving you conflicting thoughts and a decision, and you will need to **seek out all possible detail and evaluate it**

    -   **Identify problems**: what might go wrong?

    -   **Explore options**: think carefully about **what's best for you**
        -   your first intuition might be right. howerver, sometimes, **your heart needs to be balanced with a rational decision**

    -   How do the possible solutions relate to your values
        -   **make a map of your values** - from most important to least - to see where they land in your personal hierarchy

-   listen to you heart

    -   the heart is decidedly different -- **softer and simpler**

        -   in the mind, **judgments and reactions are in control** and you feel justified being judgemental and angry

    -   **shift your attention on the heart area** and **reconnect with feelings of care and appreciation** or other heart qualities of **self-compassion**, **compassion** for others, **forgiveness**, **appreciation** and **kindness**, then be able to distinguish intuitive heart feelings from mental and emotional preferences

        -   shift your attention to the area of your heart and **breather slowly and deeply**
        -   activate and sustain a genuine **feeling of appreciation or care** for someone or something in your life
        -   radiate these **feelings of care and appreciation toward yourself and others**
        -   **Notice how this extended radiation of care has affected your body, emotions and thinking**
            -   you get your head in sync with your deeper heart intent

    -   focus on your body, not your mind
        -   **what does your body feel like** right now?
            pay attention to the feeling of the clothes on your skin, and try to ignore any thoughts that you're having  
             - **experience physical sensations that are associated with emotions**

    -   Act only on the maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law
    -   **you benefit from various sorts of contributions made by different talented people in society**; by the categorical imperative, you should play your part and cultivate your talents, otherwise, it's unfair and morally wrong

-   From Mill, for your personal and social happiness
    -   you can taste your personal happiness through the cultivation of your creative imagination like the intellectual and moral dimensions
    -   when everyone fosters and contributes their talents, the outcome is more happiness in society

    -   cultivate your potentials and talents

-   **happiness comes through achieving the best version of you**

    -   aiming at **the functional excellence as a virtue** according to the natural order

        -   everything has its unique nature and function in the nature order

        -   when an object **fulfills the function of its kind to the highest level**,
            it achieves a sort of **functional excellence**
        -   **strive for functional excellence would be the ultimate purpose or final end** of the existence of anything in the universe

    -   **aim at the excellence you possess** is indeed the very source of your long-term happiness - eudaimonia

        -   an ultimate purpose for our existence in the universe is about **the development of our potentials and talents** as humans

#### 总结自[思考的技术](http://book.douban.com/subject/3138847/)

-   不要把假设和结论混为一谈; **搜集证据,印证假设到导出真正结论过程中的逻辑思考**
-   认清现象和原因的不同; **很多都不是原因,而是现象(结果)**
    -   在许多个案中,真正的原因只有其中一个,而其他只是这个原因导致的现象
-   **如果发现自己的假设是错的,重新做假设,再次出发就行了**
    -   **一直悔恨自己的人生,与固执于错误的假设是一样没有意义的**
-   在提出假设的阶段,真正的成败挑战才登场
    -   **解决问题的能力,就是为印证假设不辞辛苦的行动力**
    -   **给出的建议中,只要有一个就足够了**
-   **逻辑思考的基础在于累积事实,如果呈现的是事实,就一定要虚心接受**
    -   **当自己的意见和对方不同时,以秉持事实为证的信念**
-   线性思考行不通; 科学的方法是**问为什么,理由**
    -   **真的是这样吗? 才是工作的开始,要听的是论点**
    -   一个问题有数百个变量,且随时间而变化,所以答案不唯一; 要准确做出判断几乎不可能 ,但是**以科学的方法思考,则可做整体的控制**
    -   现在已进入像叶子不知会掉落何处的复杂体系中,几乎所有问题都没有答案
    -   **培养孩子养成动脑思考的习惯,让孩子对无解的问题设法提出假设,并不厌其烦努力证明自己的假设是否正确**
-   世界上许多问题本来就没有答案; 那些**忠于自己,能够找出属于自己的答案的人,其生命力比起已经习惯别人给出答案的人,一定更为强韧**
    -   **就算没有答案,也会自己提出假设,反复求证,直到找出答案**; 不管碰到任何困难,都勇于接受挑战,坚持到底,才是教育的根本
    -   **思考方式,重视的是如何才能导出结论**,而不是有没有知识
    -   **以假设前提进行回答,有前提就有结论的思考模式**; 对问题的前提先做个明确的假设,若前提错误,可以改变前提再回答
-   **不太需要思考的事,尽量减少思考,且绝不没事自寻烦恼,生活要非常简单,把能规律化的事情规律化**
    -   **训练自己常保持好奇心,和别人接触的机会增长见识**
    -   做一些可以让自己生存下去的投资,**请问你成长了多少**
    -   最伤脑筋的是**做什么事都半途而废的人**
    -   **碰到自己没有遇到过的问题时,尝试解决**
    -   **常常提出质疑,然后找出问题的解决方法**

### 关于实证主义哲学和生活方式

#### 从证实 到证伪

-   科学 - **可证伪性**

    -   现在科学 从发现正确 到 **修正假设，试错中 尽量接近对**

        -   科学是 **不断探索未知，修正假设的过程中的一系列实践**， 不是绝对正确的真理
        -   专家**会搞错**，但**知道怎么根据专业知识不断调整认知，尽量接近对**

    -   现在正确的，将来都可能是错误的

-   sicence needs to fail

    -   To move forward, **science needs to fail**, which runs counter to our human desire for certainty
    -   rahter than give up, we struggle along a scale of process.
        The journey to **understand more** about the mysteries of the world and **explain them with reason is the core of our nature**

    -   Science isn’t something to believe in, nor is it an absolute.
        It’s **a cyclic process of evaluating and changing your mind based on new, better evidence and data**

#### **experienced or seen** rather than theory

-   实证主义

    -   经验归纳 -> 用丰富的具象事物 来 验证 理论假设

        -   一种信息是让你认识到**更多的事实**，另外一种信息是 **加深你对世界的理解**；
            **探寻更广（非更多）的第一种信息是用来排出候选的第二种信息**，而不是用来印证第二种信息；  
            **如果没有对具象事物足够的细节把握**，抽象的思维方式很容易陷入自说自话，纸上谈兵的困境

    -   **发现一个新现象， 到依据这一新发现形成一个假设**， 再到发送一个新探测器去检测这一假设

-   判例法

    -   **经验主义** - **依靠感官认识世界， 再进行“归纳思维”**， 不同于 理性主义

        -   司法更加能动性
        -   **更能 “反馈” 以及适应社会动态**

    -   **更 “稳定和延续性”**， 更有助于确保商人的基本人权

    -   普通法 向 成文法 靠拢 （成文法（议会的法律） 优于 普通法 （法院的规定）
        -   在民主化的背景下 但保证法制

-   经验主义 -> 实证主义的方法论 -> **实验科学** 《= 归纳法， 而不是推理

    -   从观察事件入手，**从经验观察出发**， 通过精确描述，推断出自然规律， 进而证实这些事件
    -   实证科学的可操作性

    -   **通过观察归纳建立一个理论后，在该理论基础上进行演绎推理，预测可能的现象； 然后通过实证检验为这个理论及其演绎寻找** -> Bayesian

        -   **先有碎片而后不断构建框架**
        -   **不断根据新的碎片 修正甚至打破旧的框架 并构建新的框架**， 开始比较慢，但最终会后来居上

            -   先有框架后有碎片，容易上手，开始会看上去遥遥领先，但后面就僵化而无法增长
            -   框架固化后 最大坏处 是容易偏执的去 “占小便宜吃大亏”， 因为已经成为本

        -   当我们观察，了解这个世界的时候，**一定要靠更多的事实，经验做基础**， 而不是急于把它套在一个很大的理论框架，概念上

            -   很多大的成败都不是可以简单归于一般性的原因，有很多具体的原因； **很多细小的事情决定成败**，后来的成功失败又重新塑造了人们对历史对社会对人生的看法

        -   **所有的决定都是微观的**，是在具体的环境里面对具体问题做出的

    -   observe -> find patterns -> create a short-cut framework -> realize your framework sucks

        -   **ask open-ended quesitons**
        -   seeing some patterns in the answers
        -   **make a framework from these patterns**. now I can make decisions quickly
        -   wait, this is a situation my framework does not account for

    -   **证伪主义** -> 科学的工作就是 通过寻找不符合理论的观察/实验 来对理论进行证伪

-   理性主义

    -   理性推论而非经验观察提供最确实的理论知识体系
    -   知识仅仅存在于完美的独立世界； 我们感受的世界，是对完美知识世界的部分复制
    -   演绎推理

-   自由市場 vs 计划经济

    -   自由市场 是**动态均衡**， 强调 **事后纠正**
    -   计划经济 事静态均衡， 强调 **事前计划**

-   道德

    -   纳粹和社会主义者, 都**将问题于答案之间的起因和细节全部忽略**
    -   只由**问题的现象直接跳跃到 道德的答案**
        -   将一切问题引向为道德层
        -   不需要你自己百分百干净（道德评判）， 只要看你说的**是否有道理或是事实**，无论你是否别有用心，否则再干净也不行
    -   Intentions don't matter. Actions do.
        -   That's why being ethical is hard

-   cognitive vs emotional intelligence
    -   one cognitive factor is an analytical thinking style - thinking

        -   tend to act according to reason rather than intuition

    -   **emotional intelligence** - feeling
        -   easily discern the emotions and motives of others

#### Empiricism

-   **演化的保守主义** - **相信普通人的常识和习惯**

    -   抽象理念可能会出错，但常识就可靠的多，因为**常识毕竟经过时间的考验**
    -   **生活的经验，朴素的常识** 比 抽象的真理更重要
        -   “**我从不让抽象的东西主宰自己**” - 柏克
    -   一方面**直觉非常重要**，可是另一方面又要**及时吸取新的观念修正**自己的直觉

    -   from John Locke, David Hume to Edmund Burke

-   **内在世界 创造 外在世界**

    -   mind create reality

        -   我们大脑只能接受这个光谱： 苹果是红色的

    -   **我认为看到的世界** 或 **我认为看到的困境**

        -   **困境跟我們如何去感知这个困境**有直接关系； 它不是客观存在的，只不过是你认为而已
        -   走出困境一个很重要的一点 是 **要有一个不同的眼光 去看这个困境**
            -   比如 他们不知道我的需求是什么， 我没有表达我的需求

    -   如何无解的一个问题，虽然可能现在还无解，但如果我知道规律是这样的话，**如果我能从更高的角度上去看它**，**它就不一样**

        -   "No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it" - Albert Einstein

    -   when you communicate with another person, **you're exploring the depths of your own consciousness**

        -   the essence of love is **the decision to connect** or not

        -   the purpose of each relationship is to **teach you how to love yourself from the inside out**
            -   when you learn to love everyone and everything, you come into align with your true self
