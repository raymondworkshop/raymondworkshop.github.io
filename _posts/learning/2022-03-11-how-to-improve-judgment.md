#### Man's Purpose in Life  

* some basic principles of existence  

    - Acceptance of responsibility  

    - Perseverance  

    - **Strive for excellence** 
        + happiness comes from **the full use of one's power** to achieve excellence  
        
        + fill Life with achieving and exercising excellence  

        + **Mediocrity** can destroy us as surely as perils far more famous  
            - **living with excellence**   

    - Creativity  
        + To find an undeveloped situation, to see the possibilities, to decide upon a course of action, and then devote the whole of one's resources to carry it out, even if it means battling against the stream of contemporary opinion  

    - take courage to stand and fight for 
        + you have to start it over again each morning as the sun rises  


    - the development of standards of ethical and moral conduct  


*  **Life must be felt**, not observed  
    - **to create, to excel, and to be concerned** about the world and its affairs

#### The Self-Awareness Onion  
* understanding your emotions  
    - identify blind spots in ourselves and then expressing the affected emotions appropriately  
    - **fear** -> angry, upset, worried, uninspired, sad  
    - **love**   
 
* ask **why we feel certain emotions**    
    - **the root cause** of the emotions that overwhelm us. 
    Once we understand that root cause, we can ideally do something to change it   
    -  why do you feel uninspired?  why do you feel worried?  
    you failed to achieve some goal?  what you consider success or failure?  
    - **引起我情緒的那些念頭都是真的嗎**？  
    - 當下，**我的生命中，什麼才是真的**？  
        + 我提醒自己，只有我能对自己的情绪负责，从真实发生的事情中进入当下  

* your **underlying values**  
    - if you want to change how you see your problems, 
    you have to **change what you value** and **how you measure failure/success**  

    - **values-based questions** and **the metric** to assess progress toward that value  
        + why do you feel such a need to be rich in the first place?  
        + how am I choosing to measure myself?  
        By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?  
        Why do you consider this to be success/failure?  

    - define **good, healthy values**  
        + **reality-based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable**    
        + can be achieved internally, immediate and controllable and engage you with the world  
        + honesty (you have complete control over, reflects reality, and it benefits others), self-respect, curiosity, humility, creativity  
        + bad values are generally reliant on **exernal events**, **outside of your control**, socially destructive or magic to achieve  
            - manipulation or violence, being liked by everybody,
        feeling good all the time, not being liked by everybody  

    - **当我们面对内心的恐惧时， 抛开“应该”**  
    然后我们就会发现“烦”随之消散，结果比我们规划的还要好  


* **Values are about prioritization**    
    -  **you values determine the nature of your problems**, 
    the nature of your problems determines the quality of your lives  
    - **the question is your priorities**, and that therefore **influence your decision-making**

    - ch4 - The Value of Suffering


#### basic rules  
* 这个决定是**被爱，激情或其他正能量的东西驱动**，还是被恐惧所驱动  

*  **The Golden Mean** -  a balance between our rationality and our animal drives   
    - **confident yet courteous** (polite and showing respect)  
        + **knowing you're worth** and also be kind (humble and **don't look down on** others)  
        + warmth and competence

    - **appreciate the needs of the others** while we need to **advance our own interests and concerns**  
        + **too much empathy(feeling the other person's emotions)** making deep cooperation when they're likely to be exploited  

    - Trust but verify  
        + **think carefully about what we do not want to believe**,and **what we want to believe**, before we place our trust in others 
            - **establish a baseline (what constitutes "normal" behaviors)**, and start to ask pressing questions
            - **actively look for those clues** we hope not to find  


* **Concentration**  
    - become true to yourself  
    - **only concentrate on matters truly important to you**  

* **continually review and refine**    
    - Gradually improve your thinking until you can't be manipulated or controlled  
    
    - choose your friend group  
        + meet someone who has the **similar mindset & vision** as you 
    is better than finding a soul mate  

* Training your boundaries to be stronger than your heart  
    - **俗文化**： 显示的比实际的要弱一些  

* **Set yourself free from fear**  
    - already been living through the worst times  
    - the freedom would empower one to face failure courageously   
    - see this as an opportunity to be a new start    


#### THE Self-Awareness Onion  
* 自我对话  
    - 不断地问自己问题并且不接受“想当然”的答案，能够连问五次为什么的时候，
    都可以**看到我们内心深处**    

*  **understanding of one's emotions**  
    - **identify blind spots** in ourselves and the **expressing the affected emotions** appropriately  
    - [2020-06-16-notes-on-the-love-skills]


* **why we feel certain emotions**  
    - why do you fell angry?  is it because you failed?
    - help us **understand the root cause of the emothions** that overwhelm us 
    - do something to change it 

* the third level is **what you value, and how you measure failure/success**  
    - **what standard I am judging myself** and everyone around me  
    - **our values determine the nature of our problems**, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives  
        + if you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success
    - "**why does that seem true**?" 
        + "why do I consider this to be success/failure?"
        + " How am I choosing to measure myself?" 

    - some good values  - **reality-based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable** 
        + the values are achieved **internally**, and can be experienced right now
        + good values: honesty, curiosity, creativity, standing up for oneself,nonviolence  
        + bad values: dominance through manipulation or violence, being liked by everyone, ...   

* **why** or for what purpose?  


* self-improvement is about: 
    - **prioritizing better values**, **choosing better things** to give
    - when you give better fucks, you get better problems  
    - when you get better problems, you get a better life  


##### 人生的路， 如何選擇   
* 如何看待自己 - 读自我的认知    
    - 经常**看自己有什么**， 而不是没有什么  
    - **多发扬自己的长处，把自己的长处和更优秀的人比**    
    - 真正的成功， 是**活出自己的样子，也就是把自己的长处发挥到最大限度**  
    
    - **把每一次选择都作为了解自己的入口，慢慢就可以看到更多真相**    
        + 视角，情绪的思考和高效的执行力  
        +  有了对自己这样的认识，自信而不自负  

    - 独立思考， 不断纠正自己片面的判断  
        + **学会换位思考，从多角度看问题**    
        + 任何议题或政策，都要筹集足够的资讯，**分析正反两方利弊得失之后，再决定立场**    
            - 即便决定立场，应该也尊重与你选择不同的人，我们都希望越来越好，只是我们想法不同而已 

        + 做成熟有判断力的人   
            - 任何人跟你说的话，都不要照单全收，都可能有说错的时候  

* 如何看待他人  - 把每个人都看成老师和伙伴  
    - **开放的心态引导别人分享， 用有效的方式问问题**    
        + 如果会问问题，就可以了解他人多年总结的有价值经验  
    - **会问问题**，这能帮助我们理解对面的人的真实需求和经验  
        + 你为什么这么想？  
        + 你认为最大的阻力是什么？  

    - 做好自己，没有 “改变别人”的动机  

* 如何看待机会和欲望  
    - **所有的决定都是微观的**， 是在具体的环境里面对具体问题做出的  
        + 在每一个小选择里改变思维方式，锻炼能力，获得对应的成长  
        + **提高整体认知，选择做当下最适合自己，最值得做的事**    
        + 能做多少事和你的微观环境有关  
            - **要重视，挑选和管理的，就是周围的“五六个人”**  
            - 最看重的 **是否是我愿意与之一起工作的那一类人**  

    - **通过做事来“准备”的**，而不是通过“准备”来做事的  
        + 对于机会，你永远不会觉得你准备好了  
        + 面对机会，没准备好不是问题，**要勇敢把握，多“做”几次就好了**  
        多做就会积累经验，提高判断力    

    - 区分有效欲望 
        + 通过深度自我对话， 不断追问自己“**为什么要做这件事，它有多重要，多紧急**”； 
        理清不同目标的优先级

##### making good decisions  

* Concentrate on the **few important ones**   
    - the problem is **a generic situation**, and could only be solved through a decision
    which established a rule, a principle  
    - **clear specifications** to what the decisions has to accomplish  



* **focus on the process** of making a decision  
    - **emotions** are crucial in helping us come to a decision  
    - need to **listen to our feelings**   
        + some of **our deep-deated emotional reactions** might come from
        those aspects of **our personality that we are not able to change**  
        + **the heart** has its reasons which reason does not know  

* use a pros and cons list  
    - good reasons or good consequences 

* spend more time thinking carefully about a difficult and important decision
