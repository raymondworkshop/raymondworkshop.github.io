* 继续**展示自己的技术水平和经营自己的人脉**的好处依然是，机会随时可能降临

* **找一个真正的爆发时期的行业**, 否则只会出现 红海竞争, 没有拓展的机会, 这是非常困难的

* 老板的角度都是，他们能给我们什么？我们是否有这个责任一定要确实完成这些要求？

* 我仍然做我想做的事，说我想说的话， 我只是**选择不当反对派**  

* **消费驱动创新**  
    - 中国经济 是由 **房地产投资** 和**工业生产**来引领， 但消费滞后  
    - 工业 由出口驱动 

#### **families**

* **在自己喜欢的人身上用心**，**在不喜欢自己的人身上健忘**

* 人性定律：无论一个男人多么需要女人的顺从、夸奖女人的付出，他都不会发自内心的爱和欣赏这个女人
      - 玩偶再漂亮再听话，最终也只能被厌弃。

* 有**内在中心***的女人，找老公自然找能够携手一起创造美好的人，谁也不会觉得谁多付出了，谁亏欠谁了，都是在为自己想要的人生奋斗而已

* **人的发现**
    - 日本人没有经历过西欧的**文艺复兴**,全体国民都被束缚在日本神学的框架里, 也**被其教义束缚了思维**;
      所以这里没有十九世纪史学大师布克哈特说的**“人的发现”,同时也就没有人道主义产生的土壤**,
      这也是日本人通常被外国人批评**没有内在教养**的原因

    -  虽然日本人有炽烈的民族意识, 但是作为 **个人却没有独立的意识, 没有人性的真正发展**;
      而人的思维自由和政治社会活动自由都是从**个人的意识**里产生的

    - **独立的人格 -> 能对自己负责的人**
        + 科学依托于**自然规律面前人人平等的精神特质**, 契约和科学精神是一对孪生兄弟
        + 启蒙运动用 **理性解释世界, 把命运掌握在自己手中**;  启蒙运动中的理性崇拜和科学兴起


* 选择什么是文化， 能否选择是 制度

* 中共体制的心智模式  - **高度依赖确定性**
    - **在确定性的框架内, 内部人才高度竞争, 不能容纳失败**, 结果就是过度管理, 所有人都以确定为荣
    - **不确定是恐惧, 是慌张**; 失败, 是羞耻,是污点
    - 而创新, 创意, 从萌芽到长成, 就是与不确定与失败一路相伴
    - 科技创新 先于法律法规监管， 但垄断， 美国更关注一家企业的**高市场占有率是怎么得来的**
        + 在美国，只要有经过市场机制，就很难认定是垄断 <-  关注的是**过程**
        + 中国官方关注的是 不能让一或两家企业享有绝对的支配地位，当就会不安 <- 关注的是**结果**

* 中国的传统做法不是造出较好的捕鼠笼来捕捉更多的老鼠，而是**向官府谋取捕鼠特权**

* **对外部世界的不信任感和独立意识极强，缺少合作意识**

* 中国人最需要的东西是**放弃因的确不行带来的自卑导致的那份自大, 弥补性的狂妄与自卑自贱交替**
    - 改正因**精神懒惰而带来的那种宿命情结**而导致的那份给自己找核心找主子,在集体中寻找个人价值同时伺机破坏规则的狡黠

* 在人与人及国与国交往中, 只能理解主奴关系
    - 也就是上下顺从关系

* 中国对商贾名流一向以道德模范为标准, 而更成熟的商业社会通常把**职业道德和私人道德**分得很清楚

* 中国人的自我为中心，封闭，**排他性认可** -> 十月革命
    - 思想上没办法融入当地社会
    - 反对别人不包容
    - 排他性的认同

* 商业
    - 商人 可以自己组织**商会**， **自组织能力很强**
    - **产权**要有法律保障
    -  中央集权， 让政府权利太大 ->  把企业的资产当成 自己的资产

* 法家以 **底线思维** 最大化战斗力， 形不成向心力

* 中国人一次次在重要的历史转折关头往往做出最坏的选择，跟他们**看待世界的方式方法**有关
    - 习惯做**价值判断**和**是非判断**
        + 只有利益, 没有是非; 只有敌友, 没有事实
        + 因为这样做的**思维门槛低而且很容易得到支持者**
    
    - **只问立场**, 不问对错是非

    - **论敌友而不论事实和逻辑**
	+ 不是用事实和逻辑看问题，而是**先分敌友，论敌友不论事实，论利害不论是非**
	+ 是敌人，对我们多好也是敌人；是“战略伙伴关系”，骑在你头上拉屎也是伙伴

    - 中庸之道 - 凡事**喜欢和稀泥** 
        + 缺乏逻辑分析能力，缺乏讲道理的习惯 
        + 学会“**难得糊涂**”， 才能安全地生存下去 

* 中国人**喜欢难为自己**, 比如自给自足, 独立自主, 自己攻关, 努力
    - **交换和合作**  - **把精力用在更需要你的地方**
    - **站在巨人肩膀上**
    - **马上找相关领域的人合作**, 让对方去做相应部分,自己再深挖自己的部分, 强强联合

* 帽子文化
    - 国人更热衷“帽子”文化“, 认为一旦冠上帽子, 就是高质量高水平的体现

* 当人们**普遍缺乏“规则意识”、“责任意识”时**，制度要么形同虚设，要么就意味着大到惊人的实施成本

* 不需要你自己百分百干净（道德评判）， 只要看你说的**是否有道理或是事实**，无论你是否别有用心，否则再干净也不行

* 美国人
    - “斤斤计较”的**权利意识**, 更是生动注释了美国人**“权利观念”胜于“敌我观念”之精神**
    - 另外，美国社会的“公民责任意识” “当我的权益受到侵害，你要坚决捍卫我的权益；当你的权益受到侵害时，我要坚决捍卫你的权益”的**责任共同体意识**
    - 美国人的特点之一是, **尽最大努力降低信任成本**
        + 你说什么,别人就信什么, 很少浪费时间琢磨对方真实心思

*  概念
    - 中国和西方所谓的“人权”压根不是一个概念
    - 中国文化给人感觉是“你一定要**活着**”（然后小声说但是可要感恩哦不要随便说我坏话哦）
    - 英国保守党派是“你一定要可以发声”（然后小声说但是你要是病死饿死了那可能也只能怪你不努力了哦）
    - **命重要还是发声重要**？
    - 我感觉和平时期大家更想发声, 但困难时期先保住命，愿意牺牲一些自由

* 礼法传统
    - “天朝心态”, 希望给予外人超规格优待, 来达到“以德服人”
        + 换来礼法制度下的“面子”, 而**这种面子是建立在对方的尊重, 诚心悦服之上**
        + 优待客人, 这里有个隐含默契:  主人的付出, 是换取社会承认, **对方必须以感恩**作为回报, 有时候表现为**客人需要吹捧主人**
    - 西方传统中, **公民权***是最基本的法定权利, 被排斥在外的人不享有权利
    - 在中国却相反,对自己人不必客气, 而对外人的礼让,是建立在礼法的等级结构之上的

* 性格
    -  奚梦瑶的笑容把一个让人吓到苍白无力的场景，转化为整场秀最好、最动人心的时刻之一
        + 这似乎又反映了经典的中国式好面子，对比西方人**鼓励尝试、不怕失败**的精神

* 思想
    - 纳粹和社会主义者, 都讲问题于答案之间的**起因和细节全部忽略**
    - 只由**问题的现象直接跳跃到 道德的答案**


#### 中国人的教育

* 归因错误的教育方式 -> 因为别人complain或者别人有可能complain，所以我们可以教育孩子收敛一下; 而不是从一开始就告诉孩子，你本来就不应该怎么做怎么做，即便没有任何人指出来。
    - 其实根源在于，他很小时候，你就没告诉**他什么是对，什么是错，什么是客观的依据和准绳**。
    - 你教育了他这样的人生观: 一切以别人眼光为是非标准，要不就是取悦别人，要不就是试探别人底线。
    - 他在这种教育下，**没有机会建立自己的是非观**
        + 加上父母的教训总是把矛头引向别人。他自然就学会了，把能赖在别人身上的都赖在别人身上，包括也能把矛头指向教他这样做的父母

* 传统中国重视思想却不重视理论，而且不重视逻辑训练
* **念书的唯一目的就是知识**，知识与所得财富有正相关；**知识与商业报酬之间没有必然联系**

#### leadership

* 不是要追求独善其身，而是**做领军人物**。就是**用自己对某个事业的激情来感染影响帮助其他人**

#### 婚姻

* 真和诚意
    - 为对方做点什么
* 第二次没反应就不应该追了
