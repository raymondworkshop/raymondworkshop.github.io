    - sociability   
    - dynamic instability    

* balance between motivation and satisfaction
    - **finding your balance**   
    - favorable comparisons: volunteering, increases happiness 
    - unfavorable comparisons
        + can push you to great efforts  

    - negotiation process  
        + target -> motivating  
        + reservation price  -> satisfied  

    - assess if the comparison is **in/out of order**  
        + **if the expected comparison outcome that was anticipated**?  
        + if we are competitors, what do we expect?

        + status and titles are not nearly as important as **information and talent**       


#####  Deception

    - focus on **repeated actions**, both the good & bad ones  
        + negative energy, dishonesty, bad vibes, hostility  
    - have **red lines**, and if they cross them make them regret they did  
        + you don't need them or their drama  

* hints  
    - **if they hurt somebody**, there's chance they'll hurt you too  
    - **continue loving people who love you back**    
    - the best way they can apologize is to accept your punishment
