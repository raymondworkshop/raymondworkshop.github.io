#### Managing your boss

-   Think of the relationship as a partnership in which depend on each other to succeed and influecne each other

    -   Are you meeting expectations?

        -   performance targets
        -   information
            -   develop a sense of what your boss wants to know
        -   support and loyalty
            -   when you **do honestly agree with your boss**, **say so clearly and explicitly**
            -   **be generous and assume the best intentions**, even when you disagree

    -   Does your boss trust you?

        -   negotiate what you both mean by "**do the right thing**"
        -   make sure **you share a common understanding** of the challenges
        -   **make sure your boss knows your goals and plans** and agrees with them
        -   do u negotiate expectations when you're given an assignment?
            -   **do this at the beginning, and update expectations periodically**.
                warn your boss of potential risks, and play out various scenarios of how you might handle them

    -   Do u see and understand your boss as a person?

        -   do u know enough that you're **able to see the world through his eyes**?

    -   Can u identify your boss's strengths?
    -   Are u clear about what you need and expect?
        -   negotiate what you need from your boss.
            what can he do to help u?

-   Think of her dual roles as extremes between which he moves back and forth depending on the situation
    -   in small ways, **test her willingness to provide support**
        -   you can **see when, where, and how he's likely to focus on development** rather than evaluation
    -   **learn his feelings about what's important in management**
        -   such as careful planning, decisiveness, building consensus - and make sure you develop and display those qualities

#### Get to know your boss's boss

-   **Interact with her**

    -   **smile and say "hello"** when you see her
    -   **ask how you can help her**. Re-introduce yourself if you see she doesn't remember you
    -   treat her **like the very important customer** she is

-   reach out to her when oportunities arise

    -   **send her a congratulatory e-mail** if she gets a promotion or award
    -   **send her a link and ask whether she's heard about it** if you find an article or book that's relevant to her interests

-   **tap her for advice**

    -   ask for input on courses you're thinking of taking
    -   "John thought you might have some helpful insights for us...", also make your boss look good

-   leading or joining a cross-functional team is an opportunity to raise your visibility
