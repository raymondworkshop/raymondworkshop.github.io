    -   Learn to **embrace conflict**

        -   **stop avoiding hard conversations**

            -   East Asian cultures emphasise **humility and conformity over assertiveness**
            -   **Assertiveness**
                -   the quality of **being confident** and **not frightened to say what you want or believe**
                -   “**I speak up and share my views** when it is appropriate” and
                    "**I am willing to engage in constructive interpersonal confrontations**"

        -   In order to **gain respect and earn power**, you have to **be willing to embrace conflict**

            -   Those who avoid difficult conversations or resolving disputes, cannot be trusted to handle challenging situations
            -   It is critical for a leader to **be willing to confront people and resolve conflicts that impact the people** that work with you and for you

        -   **Lean into conflict** rather than shy away from it

            -   **approach-based**
                -   **confrontation**
                -   **compromise**
                -   **negotiation**
            -   avoidant
                -   withdrawal
                -   resignation

        -   Indians preferred **negotiation**, **followed by confrontation**

            -   actively seek resolution through dialogue and directness

            -   Indians are **pragmatic**
                -   **value resolution** over repression
                -   **show up more in the form of collaborative problem-solving and consensus-building**, not conflict avoidance

        -   The costs of conflict avoidance

            -   when you manage others, you have to **be willing to provide negative feedback and criticism**.
                If you are too afraid to deliver a harsh message because you’re afraid of making someone feel bad or making yourself feel uncomfortable

            -   **undermines your ability to lead because you are unwilling to confront the issues**,
                **which makes you appear weak, apathetic or oblivious**

            -   demoralises your best performers because you accept mediocrity

        -   **Steps to better embrace conflict**

            -   **Stop taking things personally**

                -   If you’ve resolved a conflict successfully, **both parties win**.
                    It might mean admitting you’re wrong, if you are in fact wrong, or it might mean the other party acknowledges their mistake. It could be both parties miscommunicated or misunderstood, but it will never get resolved without a direct conversation.

                -   if you take things too personally, you will **be overly tied to your pride and ego**

        -   **Be comfortable with discomfort**

            -   **the short term pain of pulling the Band-Aid off quickly is much better** than slowly peeling it off
            -   Learn to **deal with the anxiety and distress caused by conflict or tension**.
                The passive aggression only leads to suppressed and growing bitterness that
                is just as uncomfortable than **the momentary discomfort of directly confronting a person or situation**
            -   People who don’t like feeling uncomfortable or being in awkward situations

        -   Don’t beat around the bush

            -   be willing to **be direct and to the point**.
                You must **be intentional and explicit in what you say**, if you want the other party to fully grasp where you are coming from
            -   **firmly and confidently articulating your position**. This is often takes preparation and practice in order to clearly communicate your points

        -   Lead by Example

            -   people wanna follow a leader who **they can trust to do the right thing and take care of them**.
                If there is a team member that is being difficult or not carrying their weight, **they want a leader deal with that person firmly**.

            -   a healthy environment is created **when the team knows how to manage and resolve internal conflicts**

        -   **reframe conflict as an opportunity**

            -   What if you position conflict as a learning opportunity for all parties involved?
                **A chance for each party to openly share their frustrations and grievances with one another as an exercise to reset** through direct communication.

            -   **Most conflicts arise out of misunderstanding or miscommunication** in the first place.
                Resolving conflict allows you to bring everyone to the same table and get everyone back on the same page.

            -   Only by having a conversation, you are able to clarify your positions. You also have the opportunity to persuade them or be persuaded to find compromise.

    -   Conscious listening

        -   Listen for **the content** (mind center), **the emotions** (heart center), and **base desire** (gut center)
            being expressed by the other person.

    -   Build Trust and like - demo **you listen to them** and **reflect back what they say**
        -   **Listen attentively**, and are **genuinely curious about** what makes you tick?
        -   Ask them about themselves, **Get genuinely curious about their lives**, both at work and at home
        -   Prove that you heard them
            -   "**I think i head you say** ..."
        -   **prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting**, "The last time we talked you said ..."
        -   let them know what **you appreciate about them**

-   do not search for the truth

    -   only cease to cherish opinions

-   抗拒与投降

    -   你察觉到什么关于抗拒与投降？
        你在投降上面已有过什么样的体验了？
        只是认知，察觉到，而没有评估或执着。
        对抗拒又有什么体验？ 是否困在怨恨或欲望之中，在想要或不想要之中，在恐惧或假象的快乐之中？

    -   会被自己 **对这个人的喜好 影响**

-   中立无评估， **完全投入， 去关心 去聆聽**

    -   不加任何东西或省略任何东西的方式去反映你所听到的
    -   假如你有情绪上或思绪上的反应，**很简单的就是去察觉到它**；
        假如你被困住或迷失在你的反应之中，很简单地就是察觉到它

-   自我觀察

    -   independent
    -   被對方的情緒
        -   尤其是伤心 - 所影響

-   Ego always has and always will be the greatest obstacle to love.
    Because love is about sacrificing the self for the other,
    whilst ego is about sacrificing the other for the self. This is why mutual self sacrifice is the winning formula. No asymmetry, just reciprocity.
