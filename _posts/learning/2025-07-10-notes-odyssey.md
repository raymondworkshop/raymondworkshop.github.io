#### The Untethered Soul

-   ch1

    -   To be aware that **you are watching** the mind talks
        -   You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense making you feel more secure.
            As long as that's what you want, you will be forced to **constantly use your mind to buffer yourself** from life, instead of living it.
    -   **Come to know the one** who watches the voice

-   ch2

    -   you'll never be free of problems until **you are free from the part within** that has so many problems

        -   "**What part of me is being disturbed** by this?";
            "What part of me is jealous?"
        -   "**who notices this inner** disturbance?"

            -   To attain true inner freedom, you must be able to **objectively watch your problems** instead of being lost in them.
            -   No solution can possibly exist while you're lost in the energy of a problem

        -   go inside and **let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality**.
            -   Once you do that, you'll be clear enough to deal with what's left.

    -   **Commit yourself to the inner work of freedom**

        -   your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche.
            You have to take it back
        -   **distance yourself from your voice, psyche**

    -   **This is Your life**

        -   **Stand firm in the seat of the witness** and **release the hold** that the habitual mind has on you

    -   **Your will is stronger than the habit** of listening to that voice.
        **There is nothing you can't do**. **Your will is supreme** over all of this.

    -   Yoga

-   ch3

    -   Who are You

        -   **I am the one who sees**.
            I look out, and I am aware of the events, thoughts, and emotions that pass before me

    -   **You are behind everything**, Just watching

        -   You **sit far enough back inside to see** all **your thoughts and emotions** , as well as outer form
        -   **All of these objects are in front of you** . The thoughts are closer in, the emotions are a little further away, and form is way out there. Behind it all, there you are.

    -   You **live in the seat of consciousness**
        -   From the seat, you are aware that there are **thoughts, emotions, and a world coming in** through your senses

-   ch4
    -   TODO
