-   抗拒与投降

    -   你察觉到什么关于抗拒与投降？
        你在投降上面已有过什么样的体验了？
        只是认知，察觉到，而没有评估或执着。
        对抗拒又有什么体验？ 是否困在怨恨或欲望之中，在想要或不想要之中，在恐惧或假象的快乐之中？

    -   会被自己 **对这个人的喜好 影响**

-   中立无评估， 完**全投入， 去关心 去聆聽**

    -   不加任何东西或省略任何东西的方式去反映你所听到的
    -   假如你有情绪上或思绪上的反应，**很简单的就是去察觉到它**；
        假如你被困住或迷失在你的反应之中，很简单地就是察觉到它

-   自我觀察

    -   被對方的情緒 - 尤其是伤心 - 所影響
    -   不想聽的 會聽不到
    -   冥想
        -   經常播放被剛剛發生的事情 - 自言自語

-   Ego always has and always will be the greatest obstacle to love.
    Because love is about sacrificing the self for the other, whilst ego is about sacrificing the other for the self. This is why mutual self sacrifice is the winning formula. No asymmetry, just reciprocity.

#### The Untethered Soul

-   ch8

    -   **Fear** is the cause of every problem

    -   The purpose of spiritual evolution is to **remove the blockages that cause your fear**

        -   You simply perit the pain to come up into your heart and pass through
        -   If you want to **be free to the core of your being**, you must **let go immediately**

            -   you **notice that sth in your heart gets hit**  
                **If you let go** and stay in the seat of awareness, what you are noticing will pass
            -   You **could have taken one breath** and ** let go when it started**
            -   or **as your consciousness gets immersed in the disturbance**, you lose your clear seat of Self

        -   **Open your heart**, and **let it go as you're aware that you didn't**
            -   Do not rationalize, blame, or try to figure it out.
                **Don't do anything, Just let go immediately**, and **allow the energy to go back to the highest center of consciousness** it can achieve.
            -   **If you feel shame, let it go**. **If you feel fear**, **let it go**.

-   Soul vs Ego

    -   **The ego lives in fear** and **the soul lives in love**

        -   the ego is a person's sense of **self-importance**; it is your social mask;
            **your social mask thrives on approval**. It wants control, and it is sustained **by power**, because it lives in fear.
        -   our ego was 'created' to keep us safe. It is **a shield that protects our true emotions**
            we need to do this because of a lack of **trust**

    -   how is **big ego different from confidence**, and loving ourselves?

        -   **whether our soul is present or not**
        -   when someone's ego is too big, we categorise them as being selfish and solely focused on themselves.

    -   impossible for both the ego and the soul to be working at the same time

        -   each and everything we do feeds one of them
        -   it is up to us to **recognize which one is present and when**

    -   in each decision you make, ask yourself **is this my ego or my soul talking**

        -   这个决定是**被爱，激情或其他正能量的东西驱动**，还是被恐惧所驱动
        -   when we can recognize the difference - fear or love - and **step outside of our ego**, we can **welcome the soul in**
        -   people who seek revenge, or do sth simply for spite, are overcome by their ego

    -   spiritual and personal development is often to **quiet the ego** and **cultivate a stronger connection with the soul**

        -   this involves **recognizing the ego's patterns**, **understanding its motivations**,
            and **learning to discern its voice from the soul's gentle guidance**
        -   some people find that **breathwork**, **meditation**, or **prayer** helps them to **center themselves and clear their minds** so they can **hear the soft whisperings of their souls**. others find **journaling or spending time in nature** helps tham to connect with their inner guidance.

    -   Soul

        -   **a deeper, true self**
        -   connected to **love, peace, and compassion**
        -   guide us **towards authenticity, purpose, and inner fulfilment**
        -   through **intuition**, **gut feelings**, and gentle nudges
        -   **on being present**, **accepting**, and **finding joy** in the journey

    -   Ego
        -   **self-identity**, built on a collection of **beliefs**, **experiences**, and **self-perceptions**
        -   **driven by fear**, insecurity, and a desire for external validation
        -   seek to **protect itself**, maintain control, and achieve a sense of worth through external means
        -   through **self-doubt**, **negative self-talk**, and a focus on what's lacking
        -   on the past, the future, and **accumulating external achievements**

-   ch7

    -   You are **protecting your ego**, **your self-concept**

        -   close down the centers to **avoid being too sensitive to the different energies coming in and causing fear**
        -   **If you close and protect yourself**, **insecure person within your heart**. **You will never grow**
        -   Living like this allows for very little spontaneous joy, enthusiasm, and excitement for life

    -   **No matter how much pain the exposure** creates, you are **willing to pay that price for freedom**
        -   **How often do U find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part** of you?
            **You start by watching life** and **noticing the constant flow of people and situations that hit your stuff** every day
    -   The reward for not protecting your psyche is **liberation**

        -   **You are free to walk through this world without a problem on your mind**.
            **you are just having fun experiencing** whatever happens next. **Because you got rid of that scared part of you**, you don't ever have to worry about getting hurt.
        -   **You just go about your business** and **put your whole being into whatever's happening**, instead of putting your whole being into your personal sensitivity.

    -   **Your growth takes place** onece you've **made the commitment to free yourself of that scared person inside**

        -   **You notice a emotion or thought emerges**, **relax behind it**. **Don't judge it**, **don't try to change it**.
        -   if you **use your inner willpower to not go with it**, and just remain seated within.

    -   **you decide to use life to free yourself**. **You become willing to pay any price for the freedom of your soul**

        -   A wise person remains centered enough to **let go every time the energy shifts into a defensive mode**. The moment the energy moves and **you feel your consciousness start to get drawn into it**, you **relax and release**. **Falling behind the energy** instead of going into it. It just takes a moment of **conscious effort to decide that you're not going there**. You just let go.
        -   It doesn't matter what others do, **unless you decide that it matters to you**.
            Only you can take inner freedom away from yourself or give it to yourself.

    -   **Learn to let go no matter how deep the pain**, you will achieve a great state.

-   ch6

    -   You are the **experiencer of your spiritual heart**

        -   **You feel the heart's energy all the time**

            -   what it is like to feel love in your heart
            -   what it is like to feel inspiration and enthusiasm pour from your heart
            -   what it is like to feel energy well up in your heart making you confident and strong

        -   **All of the different things happen because the heart goes through changes**
            -   we **fall in love if the heart** opens; the love stops if the heart closes
            -   if the heart happens to **hurt, we get angry**
            -   if we stop **feeling it altogether, we get empty**

    -   **All the inner noise is just your attempt to process the blocked energy** and get it out of the way

        -   It is **truly amazing to step back and look at this process**
            -   As you willfully struggle to keep these events from passing through your consciousness,
                **the energy first tries to release by manifesting through the mind**. it **then tries to release through the heart**. **That is what creates all the emotional activity**.
                **When you resist even that release**, the energy gets packed up and forced into deep storage within the heart.
        -   you are **wasting precious energy by blocking the flow through resisting and clinging**
            -   **those that cause either problems or some sense of enjoyment**

    -   **Enjoy life instead of clinging to it or pushing it away**

        -   **If you can live like this, each moment will change you**.
            If you are **willing to experience the gift of life** instead of fighting with it,
            you will **be moved to the depth of your being**.
        -   when you reach this state, you will begin to see the secrets of the heart.
            -   **The heart is the place through which energy flows to sustain you**. This energy inspires you and raises you.
        -   **Just open**, **relax your heart**, **forgive**, **smile**, or **do anything you want**
            -   Just don't push it back down
            -   **be willing to let it go** when it gets stimulated. **It only hurts for a minute and then it's over**
                -   when that light blue Mustang drives by and **you feel fear or jealousy**, **just smile**.
                    **Be happy that** this Samskara, which has been stored down there for all this time, **has the opportunity to make it through you**.

    -   **Simply allow the experiences of life to come in and pass through your being**

        -   **Be centered enough to just watch this stuff come up**. **Just let it all happen**. Don't process them.
        -   **stop fighting it**, they'll come up constantl yand pass right through you

        -   **Your reward is a permanently open heart**
            -   **You live in love**, and **it feeds you and strengthens you**;
                **Allow yourself to experience every note the heart can play**.

-   ch5

    -   you don't feel **this energy when you close your heart or close your mind**

    -   **Spiritual energy** - Spirit - is what you're experiencing when love rushes up into your heart

        -   this flow of energy comes from the depth of your being
        -   we are programmed based on our past impressions such that all kinds of things can cause us to open and close

    -   **Embrace life with all your heart and soul**

        -   **No matter what it is**, it's beautiful when you feel that way inside
            -   **Train yourself to open** every time
        -   **Honor and respect the situation**. **Deal with it with openness**
            -   "No. I'm not going to close. **I'm going to relax**. **I'm going to let this situation take place** and **be there with it**."
        -   **Enjoy all of life**. **Dare to be different**

            -   As long as you are defining what you like and what you don't like, you will open and close.
                You are actually defining your limits

    -   **You become a source of light** for all those around you
        -   **people can pick up on your energy**, and you're feeding them with this flow
        -   if you love life, nothing is worth closing over

-   ch4

    -   meditation
        -   you must not only have the ability to **focus your consciousness completely on one object**,
            you must also have the ability to make awareness itself be that object
    -   You just **happen to be watching one**
        -   **The world is just something you're watching**
            **The more you are willing to just let the world be sth you're aware of**,
            **the more it will let you be who you are - the Soul, the Self**
        -   **Instead of just focusing on intently on this one human being's thoughts, emotions, and sensory world**, **you can pull back and see everything**. **You can move from the finite to the infinite**.
            this is what Christ, buddha try to tell us.

-   ch1

    -   To be aware that **you are watching** the mind talks
        -   You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense making you feel more secure.
            As long as that's what you want, you will be forced to **constantly use your mind to buffer yourself** from life, instead of living it.
    -   **Come to know the one** who watches the voice

-   ch2

    -   There's a **separation between you and the anger of the jealousy**

        -   **The first is you**, **the awareness**, **the witness**, **the center of your willful intentions**

            -   The other is that which you watch

        -   Just be aware of it
            -   **sit inside yourself for a while** in complete solitude and silence
            -   you're so close that you don't realize that **you're actually hypnotized into listening to the voice**
            -   **if you could get rid of the voice**, the peace and serenity would be the nicest vacation you're ever had

    -   you'll never be free of problems until **you are free from the part within** that has so many problems

        -   "**What part of me is being disturbed** by this?";
            "What part of me is jealous?"
        -   "**who notices this inner** disturbance?"

            -   To attain true inner freedom, you must be able to **objectively watch your problems** instead of being lost in them
            -   No solution can possibly exist while you're lost in the energy of a problem

        -   go inside and **let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality**
            -   Once you do that, you'll be clear enough to deal with what's left

    -   **Commit yourself to the inner work of freedom**

        -   your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche.
            You have to take it back
        -   **distance yourself from your voice, psyche**

    -   **This is Your life**

        -   **Stand firm in the seat of the witness** and **release the hold** that the habitual mind has on you

    -   **Your will is stronger than the habit** of listening to that voice.
        **There is nothing you can't do**. **Your will is supreme** over all of this.

    -   Yoga

-   ch3

    -   Who are You

        -   **I am the one who sees**.
            I look out, and I am aware of the events, thoughts, and emotions that pass before me

    -   **When you just look without creating thoughts**, your consciousness is effortlessly aware of, and fully comprehends, all that it sees

        -   the is your soul/self - **awareness, consciousness, and intuitive sense of existence**

    -   **You are behind everything**, Just watching

        -   You **sit far enough back inside to see** all **your thoughts and emotions** , as well as outer form
        -   **All of these objects are in front of you** . The thoughts are closer in, the emotions are a little further away, and form is way out there. Behind it all, there you are.

    -   You **live in the seat of consciousness**
        -   From the seat, you are aware that there are **thoughts, emotions, and a world coming in** through your senses
