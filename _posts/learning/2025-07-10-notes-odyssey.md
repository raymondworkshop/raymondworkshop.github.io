-   SELF

    -   为什么会觉得自己应该为对方的失误负责 - 过度责任感

        -   **对自己和他人都有很高的期望值**， 害怕让别人失望，**也害怕失败**； 这让你对责任敏感， 把他人的难处或错误也归咎于自己
        -   **缺乏肯定， 时常被指责**， 形成了“**都是我不好**”的惯性思维， 习惯于承担超出自己实际范围的责任
        -   **自信心和自我价值观不足**， 习惯于“内归因”， **把外部事件都解释为自己的原因**， 事缺乏安全感和肯定的一种补偿模式。
            这样可以让自己有掌控感， 虽然事实上事不合理的。

        -   **区分 哪些事自己真的能控制，需要负责的**， 哪些是”别人要学会自己承担“的部分，逐步放下那些不该属于自己的负担

        -   **自我宽恕与接纳不完美**
            -   **人非圣贤**； 自省的目的是改进，而不是打击自己

    -   自己缺乏 关爱和肯定？

-   SELF

    -   多分享

        -   有什麼不快 分享出來 自己會感覺更開放，更放鬆， 更開心一些

        -   **自己是來學習的**

            -   講出來後 會覺得 更開放， 更放鬆一些

    -   講感受的時候老是沈默
        -   抗拒
        -   沒有安全感
        -   自己是個小組長害怕沒那麼好
            -   這更多的是權利， 而不是責任

    -   表达自己不够

        -   不够开放
        -   害怕受伤
            -   报复
        -   害怕别人 judgement
            -   香港人真是好好, 老是**鼓励你,包容你**

    -   抗拒分享

        -   不知道大致标准在哪里
        -   尴尬, 没有安全感, 不好意思; 没有感受到大家的好意

            -   **Love** 和 **caring** 是底层

                -   **用爱而不是恨来对待这个给过你伤害的世界**; 相对于爱,人们更愿意选择恨.
                    因为**恨比爱容易,操作简单而且责任不在我**,甚至让我更有力量.但恨的结果就是相互对抗,两败俱伤.

            -   **you have the power to be YOU**. **Not the extension of anybody else**

                -   **You don't have to do that to yourself**. **Start calling yourself a yogi** or someone who is great at yoga
                -   **Move your attention away from the story of being** 'bad at speaking' and **onto the context** I am speaking on. **If I'm fully focused on what I want to say**, **I don't have time to spend on the negative beliefs**.

            -   **个人只是做成事的一个工具**

                -   **如果事情事对的**， 能做好， **那自己的姿势好不好看并不重要**

                    -   事实是，**除了你自己， 没有人那么在意你的姿势好不好看**
                    -   **把注意力 放在自己做的事情上**， 而不是 周围人的目光中

                -   根本原因是**这件事是一件对的事**； 如果有机会做这件事，**成为做这件事的‘工具’**； 就**要把自己这个‘工具“不断变得更好**，**把这件事做成**

                -   唯一能让你自己坚持的东西成为现实的办法，就是**你自己当领导**

        -   **you always judgement yourself** not compassion for yourself

            -   **全然接纳真实的自我**

                -   **我当然会努力** ，但努力的原因不是你告诉我满分是 100 分，我只有 80 分；
                    而是**因为我知道自己可以做得更好**
                -   父母对孩子的不断认可，**教会孩子的自我接纳**
                    -   “你是天底下最棒，最美的孩子”

            -   **Self-belief**
                -   Developing self-belief is about cultivating an internal state of **trust and acceptance in yourself**

    -   面对一个个**不敢**

        -   自己不成功 不能放在 害怕 别人 身上

            -   这是个假设

        -   害怕自己不够好

        -   害怕別人非议

            -   不可能让所有人满意
            -   有好多人憎你，**代表你表达足够清晰的意见**
            -   害怕报复
            -   **宁愿做一个清晰的人**， 也不要做一个想讨好全世界的人
                -   有自己的意见
                -   stand for 自己的意见， 然后有自己的一席之地

        -   **做一个不完美的真人**， 而不是完美的假人

    -   Why you have no power

        -   Mastering imposter syndrome, and **describing yourself in positive** rather than self-deprecating ways, is critical for achieving power and success

            -   If you do not think of yourself as powerful, competent, and deserving

        -   **We care too much about what others think of us**

            -   ‘saving face’ taught us to believe that our sense of validation comes from external opinions

            -   When we realise that **people don’t think about us nearly as much as we imagine they do**,
                we **become free of the shackles of their opinions and judgement**. **Our desire to be liked can become debilitating**.

                -   “If you want to be liked, get a dog”

            -   **you don’t need to be liked by everyone**, you also don’t need to like everyone you work with + The most powerful people are really good at not giving away how they really feel about others.
                In reality you have no idea how they actually feel about you, because they hide it so well

        -   Break the rules

            -   the ‘rules’ are made to **benefit the people already in power**
                -   When you break the rules is when you stand out from the crowd
            -   **Get over your ego** and **ask for help** or ask for things
                -   they are afraid that they will be rejected or **embarrassed**.
                    **The worst someone can say is no** and **you’ll be no worse off than when you began**

        -   Appear powerful

        -   Network relentlessly - build trust and relationships with people

            -   the first principle of networking is **generosity**

            -   the best way to build a network is to **build trust by helping others without expecting sth in return**

            -   Ideally you should be strategic about **who you want to network with**

    -   **Think NOT BIG**

    -   [Not Feeling 'enough'](https://www.joyparade.co/blog/not-feeling-enough)

        -   **I let the world tell me who I was**

            -   I learned the things to do and not to do **in order to avoid being judged and never weird**
            -   I started tying my worthiness to outside sources like how people treated me, how loved I was and what people said to me

        -   **decide who you are**

            -   **you have to take responsibility for your life**. This means, **not blaming others for your limited beliefs** and **realizing you have the power to be you**. **Not the extension of anybody else**

            -   If you believe you are bad at yoga, **start telling yourself a different story**.
                That 'bad at yogo' belief is most likely there because you compare yourself to another person in a yoga class who was more flexible or who held a plank longer than you.
                You are taking in a story from the outside world but **you don't have to do that to yourself**.
                Especially if you want to keep practicing yoga, **start calling yourself a yogi**. Or someone who is great at yoga.

            -   I thought I was a poor public speaker for a long time. And that passed **when I could move my attention away from the story of being 'bad at speaking' and onto the content I'm speaking on**. **If I'm fully focused on what I want to say**, **I don't have time to spend on the negative beliefs**.

            -   That feeling of 'not enough' isn't your ture self speaking. **It's just the layers of beliefs we've taken on from the outside world**

    -   **Intention** - "what is **the inner motivation behind** XYZ action?"

        -   **Am I doing or engaging in sth based on fear or on love**?
        -   when You consistently do sth that a part of me judges, it's a good time to check in and ask what the inner motivatio is
        -   **Understanding the intention behind actions and behaviors unveils so much about what we believe to be true**.
            And what's great is that the moment we become aware of the beliefs, they can be seen through as anything but real and true.

            -   an enormous amount of compassion and understanding

        -   **When I take action from a place of love**, **the action itself and even any outcomes from it feel so much better and joyous** than an action taken out of fear

        -   **reframe conflict as an opportunity**

            -   What if you position conflict as a learning opportunity for all parties involved?

-   Ego always has and always will be the greatest obstacle to love.
    Because love is about sacrificing the self for the other,
    whilst ego is about sacrificing the other for the self. This is why mutual self sacrifice is the winning formula. No asymmetry, just reciprocity.

-   My object in the journey

    -   Free Spirit
    -   understanding youself - build self-acceptance
        -   understand who you are and who you want to be
        -   practise self-awareness
            -   keeping journals, going to a therapist
                or talking to friends
            -   learn more about who you are and why you do what you do
    -   True connections

-   Odyssey

    -   To study the self
    -   to forget the self
    -   to be enlightened by all things
    -   If the mind is empty, it's always ready for anything

-   believe -> attitude -> behavor -> resist

-   Active listening
    -   meditation
