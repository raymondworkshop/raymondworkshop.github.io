#### The Untethered Soul

-   ch7

    -   TODO

-   ch6

    -   You are the **experiencer of your spiritual heart**

        -   **You feel the heart's energy all the time**

            -   what it is like to feel love in your heart
            -   what it is like to feel inspiration and enthusiasm pour from your heart
            -   what it is like to feel energy well up in your heart making you confident and strong

        -   **All of the different things happen because the heart goes through changes**
            -   we **fall in love if the heart** opens; the love stops if the heart closes
            -   if the heart happens to **hurt, we get angry**
            -   if we stop **feeling it altogether, we get empty**

    -   **All the inner noise is just your attempt to process the blocked energy** and get it out of the way

        -   It is **truly amazing to step back and look at this process**
            -   As you willfully struggle to keep these events from passing through your consciousness,
                **the energy first tries to release by manifesting through the mind**. it **then tries to release through the heart**. **That is what creates all the emotional activity**.
                **When you resist even that release**, the energy gets packed up and forced into deep storage within the heart.
        -   you are **wasting precious energy by blocking the flow through resisting and clinging**
            -   **those that cause either problems or some sense of enjoyment**

    -   **Enjoy life instead of clinging to it or pushing it away**

        -   **If you can live like this, each moment will change you**.
            If you are **willing to experience the gift of life** instead of fighting with it,
            you will **be moved to the depth of your being**.
        -   when you reach this state, you will begin to see the secrets of the heart.
            -   **The heart is the place through which energy flows to sustain you**. This energy inspires you and raises you.
        -   **Just open**, **relax your heart**, **forgive**, **smile**, or **do anything you want**
            -   Just don't push it back down
            -   **be willing to let it go** when it gets stimulated. **It only hurts for a minute and then it's over**
                -   when that light blue Mustang drives by and **you feel fear or jealousy**, **just smile**.
                    **Be happy that** this Samskara, which has been stored down there for all this time, **has the opportunity to make it through you**.

    -   **Simply allow the experiences of life to come in and pass through your being**

        -   **Be centered enough to just watch this stuff come up**. **Just let it all happen**. Don't process them.
        -   **stop fighting it**, they'll come up constantl yand pass right through you

        -   **Your reward is a permanently open heart**
            -   **You live in love**, and **it feeds you and strengthens you**;
                **Allow yourself to experience every note the heart can play**.

-   ch5

    -   you don't feel **this energy when you close your heart or close your mind**

    -   **Spiritual energy** - Spirit - is what you're experiencing when love rushes up into your heart

        -   this flow of energy comes from the depth of your being
        -   we are programmed based on our past impressions such that all kinds of things can cause us to open and close

    -   **Embrace life with all your heart and soul**

        -   **No matter what it is**, it's beautiful when you feel that way inside
            -   **Train yourself to open** every time
        -   **Honor and respect the situation**. **Deal with it with openness**
            -   "No. I'm not going to close. **I'm going to relax**. **I'm going to let this situation take place** and **be there with it**."
        -   **Enjoy all of life**. **Dare to be different**

            -   As long as you are defining what you like and what you don't like, you will open and close.
                You are actually defining your limits

    -   **You become a source of light** for all those around you
        -   **people can pick up on your energy**, and you're feeding them with this flow
        -   if you love life, nothing is worth closing over

-   ch4

    -   meditation
        -   you must not only have the ability to **focus your consciousness completely on one object**,
            you must also have the ability to make awareness itself be that object
    -   You just **happen to be watching one**
        -   **The world is just something you're watching**
            **The more you are willing to just let the world be sth you're aware of**,
            **the more it will let you be who you are - the Soul, the Self**
        -   **Instead of just focusing on intently on this one human being's thoughts, emotions, and sensory world**, **you can pull back and see everything**. **You can move from the finite to the infinite**.
            this is what Christ, buddha try to tell us.

-   ch1

    -   To be aware that **you are watching** the mind talks
        -   You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense making you feel more secure.
            As long as that's what you want, you will be forced to **constantly use your mind to buffer yourself** from life, instead of living it.
    -   **Come to know the one** who watches the voice

-   ch2

    -   There's a **separation between you and the anger of the jealousy**

        -   **The first is you**, **the awareness**, **the witness**, **the center of your willful intentions**

            -   The other is that which you watch

        -   Just be aware of it
            -   **sit inside yourself for a while** in complete solitude and silence
            -   you're so close that you don't realize that **you're actually hypnotized into listening to the voice**
            -   **if you could get rid of the voice**, the peace and serenity would be the nicest vacation you're ever had

    -   you'll never be free of problems until **you are free from the part within** that has so many problems

        -   "**What part of me is being disturbed** by this?";
            "What part of me is jealous?"
        -   "**who notices this inner** disturbance?"

            -   To attain true inner freedom, you must be able to **objectively watch your problems** instead of being lost in them
            -   No solution can possibly exist while you're lost in the energy of a problem

        -   go inside and **let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality**
            -   Once you do that, you'll be clear enough to deal with what's left

    -   **Commit yourself to the inner work of freedom**

        -   your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche.
            You have to take it back
        -   **distance yourself from your voice, psyche**

    -   **This is Your life**

        -   **Stand firm in the seat of the witness** and **release the hold** that the habitual mind has on you

    -   **Your will is stronger than the habit** of listening to that voice.
        **There is nothing you can't do**. **Your will is supreme** over all of this.

    -   Yoga

-   ch3

    -   Who are You

        -   **I am the one who sees**.
            I look out, and I am aware of the events, thoughts, and emotions that pass before me

    -   **When you just look without creating thoughts**, your consciousness is effortlessly aware of, and fully comprehends, all that it sees

        -   the is your soul/self - **awareness, consciousness, and intuitive sense of existence**

    -   **You are behind everything**, Just watching

        -   You **sit far enough back inside to see** all **your thoughts and emotions** , as well as outer form
        -   **All of these objects are in front of you** . The thoughts are closer in, the emotions are a little further away, and form is way out there. Behind it all, there you are.

    -   You **live in the seat of consciousness**
        -   From the seat, you are aware that there are **thoughts, emotions, and a world coming in** through your senses
