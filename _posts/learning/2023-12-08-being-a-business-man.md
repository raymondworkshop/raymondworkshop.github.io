        it's about **bringing somebody satisfaction** at the end of the deal
        -   **list "other benefits"**
    -   ask yourself **what other factors could be in play**

-   **make the opening offer on the table for** the rest of the conversation

    -   **having information** that adjusts the gravity of the negotiation
