##### 爱能使情势改观

如果我的配偶爱我, 我可以**放松**, 知道我的爱人不会伤害我; 在他面前, 我觉得安全;
配偶爱我这一事实, **满足了我对自我价值的感觉**; 她的爱建立了我的自尊

当我的配偶有爱心地投资了时间, 精力, 和努力在我身上, 我可以感觉到自身的重要
缺少了爱, 我可能一生都在追寻意义, 自我价值, 和安全感; 但**当我经验到爱, 它积极地影响了所有的需要**

**有了爱, 可以感受到安全, 自我价值, 自尊**; 以后我有发展自我潜力的自由, 而不被自我需要缠绕;
真实的爱总是使我们自由

**感覺受人所愛**是人最重要的情緒需求.
感受到配偶的愛, 是婚姻願望中最基本的需要

**保持愛箱常滿**對婚姻非常重要

恋爱是一种暂时性自我界限之瓦解形成的; 它是内在性动力和外在性刺激的一种反应
我需要被一个人爱, 这个人选择爱我, 看到我有值得爱的地方.

**有理性, 有意志的爱**; 是为了**使对方得益而投注精力所做的努力**;
**知道她的生命, 因为你的努力, 变得更丰富, 于是你也会有满足感**(真正爱了一个人的那种满足**;
**它不需要“恋爱”经验那种陶醉感\*\*

**渴望能感受到来自配偶的情和爱**; 当**我们确定, 我们的伴侣接纳, 需要我们**, 而且**为我们的福祉做承诺的时候, 我们会觉得安全**

当你配偶的情绪箱满了之时, 她在你的爱里会觉得安全; 她会走出来, 发挥生命中最高的潜力

我們如何滿足彼此那種覺得被愛, 深刻, 及情感上的需要?
