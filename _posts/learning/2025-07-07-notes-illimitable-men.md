#### Monk Mode

-   **People who create** are more interesting than people who don't
    because **they apply their essence to an art form**.

    -   In doing this **they add value to themselves**, they are **more developed human-beings** and **thus more interesting**.

-   **Produce more**, consume less

    -   **do consumptive things far less** than productive things.
    -   make this a habit and a way of life, and you will see both your quality of life and bank balance rise.
    -   Min hobbies that are consumptive and acquire hobbies that are productive.
    -   developing a hobby, and the monetising it into a product or service.

    -   80% of your time should be spent on producing, 20% is spent on consumption.

-   enjoying work

    -   **achieve a hobby, and become an expert**; You can work and have fun.

-   **avoid victim mentality**

    -   escape losers and seek lessons from winners

    -   losers

        -   losers have a scarcity mindset
        -   losers are a needy personality

    -   **work for youself** as soon as you can
        -   because they're **not Machiavellian enough**

-   Winners **need a goal higher than themselves**

-   Quality beats quantity

#### Woman's love

-   woman's love is a **lust for your power** and an **obsession with how your character makes her feel**

    -   Male sacrifice is expected, and freely given

    -   **Lust** is the basis for her love; women are masters of self-deception

    -   women are emotionally neurotic
        -   unfair to expect her to love you the same way your mother did

-   **truth preference**
    -   desire to know the truth, and ability to embrace it and endure it and accept it
        rather than reject it because they do not like it

#### **personal power**

-   Understanding Narcissism

    -   The narcissism truly **believes they are superior** to everybody else
        simply because **they are who they are and they exist**
    -   **fake it** till you make it

        -   **people of low self-esteem** and strive to be like the person they admire
        -   people assume that self-love ones are high value

    -   **they value their ego** over truth
        -   If they do not avoid or completely ignore an attack on their ego, they will **deny reality/logic outright to preserve their ego**

-   Understanding Machiavellianism

    -   Machiavellians have a tendency to view things purely in terms of **value exchange** and care little for anything else

        -   objectify **humans down to their utilitarianism** rather than **perceive them as entities with personalities** to be admired

    -   Women are controlling, always fight for control of the relationship

        -   **they prioritise what a person can do for them over** forming emotional bonds

-   Understanding Psychopathy

    -   how your brain connects your **behavioural choices to your sense of guilt, empathy**

    -   **the lack of ability to feel guilt or fear** as consequent of their personal choices is
        a great source of the power

    -   The sheer unpredictability and audaciousness of the psychopathic element is what addicts women to these individuals, the spontaneity and impulsivity is electric
        -   **Psychopathy is the delivery system of the machiavellian core**, the spontaneity,
            the audaciousness, the guile

#### negotiation

-   perceptions in negotiation - friend or foe?
    -   In the presence of **hatred or a need for revenge**,
        otherwise logical and desirable outcomes are rejected in favor of schadenfrede.
-   the narcissism of negotiation

    -   high self-esteem + shit-test
        -   they're worth more than they really are because they're good at making weak people agree to bad deals
        -   a successful businessman is simply a person with **high self-esteem** that
            is **skilled at finding people with money and low self-esteem**, insecurity being an incredibly profitable emotion
        -   **shit-test**
            -   TODO
    -   do they have alternatives?
        -   you can play to their ego by telling them if an inferior service is what they're after.
        -   lightly offend anybody who considers their need or problem serious, and thus worth paying more to get a quality of service equal to the seriousness of their problem.

-   **The discount** if you're in a buyer's market

    -   If they pay up but cannot afford your services in the future, **offer a tactical discount in an attempt to retain their business (say 10%)**

        -   Do not offer a steep discount as it damages the perception you provide an elite service
        -   elite servies are not cheap services

    -   **use the discount gambit to feed their ego**, feeling warm, fuzzy and proud of themselves for the old customers

    -   Only offer the discount if you're in a buyer's market

-   **Opening offers**

    -   **agree to do sth for free** and **be owed a favor** if the person you're dealing with is very powerful

        -   or give it to them cheaply so **you can leverage your generosity later on**
        -   when dealing with the powerful, it's better to be paid in favor rather than money,
            as their favor is more effective at getting you out of a tight spot than their money

    -   **Ask for 3 times** what you value yourself when they want you to make the first offer
        -   **Value yourself highly**
            -   they wanna see how much you value your services
        -   people like to offer you 50-75% of what you asked for to feel like they got a bargain

-   **General Maxims**

    -   If you are surprised someone has made you a really great offer, **do not let on**
        -   **Hide your excitement**, **act entitled**, **even slightly offended to see if you cannot squeeze the other party for a little more**
        -   say like "Yes, I find this agreeable" sounds far more composed than "that's so awesome"
    -   If you feel you are taking more than you deserve
        -   **Hide your guilt**, **remain stern**, **but be friendly**.
        -   **you deserve it**.
