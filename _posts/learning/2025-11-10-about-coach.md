#### Coach as a leader

-   You don't need to have all the solutions

    -   You do need to be able to **connect with people**, to **inspire them to do their best**,
        and to **help them search inside** and **discover their own answers**

-   It's unrealistic and ill-advised to expect leaders to have all the answers

    -   **By using coaching**, leaders can still be effective without knowing all the answewrs
        and without telling employees what to do
    -   Coaching is about **connecting with people**, **inspiring them to do their best**, and **helping them to grow**
        -   Coaching is also about **challenging people to come up with the answers they require on their own**

-   Asking open-ended questions

    -   init "so, **where would you like to start**?"

        -   may well set some limits to the conversation
        -   "**I'm not prepared to talk about** the budget today"
        -   "**I'd like to discuss** last week's meeting, in addition to what's on your list"

    -   identify different modes of inquiry
        -   diagnostic inquiry
            -   focusing the other person's **attention** on specific aspects of their story,
                such as **feelings and reactions**, **underlying causes or motives**, or **actions taken or contemplated**
            -   "You seem frustrated with Chris. **How's that relationship going**?"
            -   "It sounds like there's been some tension on your team. **What do you think is happening**?"
            -   "That's an ambitious goal for that project. **How are you planning to get there**?"
        -   Confrontational inquiry
            -   Challenge aspects of their story by **introducting new ideas and hypotheses**
            -   "You've been talking about Chris's shortcomings. **How might you be contributing to** the problem?"
            -   "That's an exciting plan, but it has a lot of moving parts. **What happens if** you're behind schedule?"

-   Listen

    -   make the other person truly feel heard
        -   eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, tics

-   Empathize

    -   Empathy is the ability not only to comprehend **another person's point of view**,
        but also to vicariously **experience their emotions**

    -   **Feeling and expressing empathy** is critical to helping the other person defuse their embarrassment

        -   shame - the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that **we are flawed** and **therefore unworthy of love and belonging**
        -   when employees need your help they are likely **experiencing some form of shame**

    -   traps when trying to express empathy

        -   **compare our issues to theirs** (my problem's worse)
        -   try to be **overly positive** (look on the bright side)
        -   **leap to problem-solving while ignoring what they're feeling** in the moment

    -   expressing empathy need not prevent you from holding people to high standards
        -   After you've acknowledged an employee's **struggles and feelings**,
            they're **more likely to respond to your efforts** to motivate improved performace

#### Shame & Empathy

-   connection

    -   **forge meaningful authentic relationships** with other people
    -   **connection** is what breathes lives and gives meaning to our lives

-   Vulnerability

    -   **Open**, willing to **share not only our strengths** with people, but **our struggles**
        that moves us towards empathy

-   Empathy

    -   **Empathy** is about being vulnerable with people in their vulnerability

-   Shame

    -   Shame is the feeling that we are fundamentally flawed or unworthy

        -   Shame is **a belief that we are the problem**

            -   **Shame** breeds fear, blame, and disconnection

        -   Fear arises as a protective resposne to that shame

            -   We fear being seen, judged, or cast out because shame tells us we're not good enough

        -   **Fear of vulnerability**

            -   Shame makes openness feel dangerous.
                Vulnerability could lead to more shame, so we fear being emotionally honest.

            -   **Build empathy**
                -   Set boundaries
                    -   openness doesn't mean oversharing.
                        You can **be authentic while protecting your emotional space**
                -   **Sharing with trusted people** can dissolve shame
                -   Remind yourself that **imperfection is human**

        -   Fear of judgment

            -   Shame convinces us we'll be **criticized** or humiliated, so we fear situations where we might be evaluated

        -   Fear of failure
            -   Shame links failure to **personal inadequacy**, making us afraid to try, risk, or grow

    -   The awareness of human separation, **without reunion by love** - is the source of shame

        -   It is at the same time the source of **guilt and anxiety**

    -   How do I tell these stories which is the only way
        that we get out from underneath shame?

        -   I can't let you see these pieces of me
            because I fear that it will cause disconnection

    -   courage, compassion & connection
        -   courage meant to speak your mind with your heart to tell your story
        -   how do I stay open and sit in that with you as opposed to moving into blame if you share your story with me?
