### **manage up**    

#### Embrace managing up  
*  if you don't manage up, you'll waste time on  
    - needless back-and-forth  
    - avoidable misunderstandings  
    - confusion on how you're adding value  

* TODO  

* reference

#### treat your manager as a **coach**, not as a judge  
* 主动向老板寻求反馈  
    - **主动问问上司**，你的哪些工作令他们印象深刻，还有哪些方面需要改进 

* 定期要求与之会面，定期了解他对你的看法    

* 把重点放在应该完成哪些目标上， 更好地了解管理层对自己的期望，不仅涉及日常工作，还包括长期思维
  
* 自己的事情主动跟进，有什么问题就跟老板说，讨论， 如果不是自己管辖范围内的事情，别人开心就好
这里最重要的是你对你提出的问题已经找到合适的解决方案。  


* It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes your job to help the entreprenuer **find a reasonable solution** which is merely hard and **gets most of what they wanted**. A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.  


### how to mange down  

#### Giving Feedback - in a way that was helpful and direct, but also kind and thoughtful  

* **Ask first**  
    - so that the person can be mentally prepared for it ahead of time  
    - "Would you like to hear a suggestion?"  
    - "Do u mind if I give you feedback?"  

    - or start off by asking them "How do u think it went? what do u think was good, what could we improve"  
  

* **compliment + criticism + compliment**  
    -  "The work you ... good; " + "However, ..., it might be better"  

* be timely  
    - feedback is more effective when it is at the time of the event  
    - If too much time has elasped, use judgement  

* Make it about the task, not the person  
    - like **"Adding headers to the email would make it easier to read"**    

* **Give suggestions** on how to improve  
    - tell them how - **give them examples and ideas** on how to make something better  
    - more actionable 

* Provide a personal example  
    - easier to receive is to make the recipient feel like they are not the only one making the mistake  
    - **"I learned this the hard way"** or "**I used to do the same thing**"  

* provide people **the "why"** behind your suggestions  
  
* Allow the person to defend/vent/explain  
    - the receiving party may react by defending or justifying their approach  
    - if that, **just listen and allow them** to say their piece  
    - more ofthen than not they will still make the changes, but **knowing that you heard their side of things will make them feel better**    

* **把事情的前因后果说清楚**， 同时明确告知需要执行的事项

    you will be **someone who makes everyone better**


#### The art of **delegating**    
* change your mindset 
    - have to **focus on growth and education**, not necessarily efficiency. 

* Adopt a **leader:leader** model instead of a leader:follower    
    - Being a good leaders means allowing the people around you to be the experts in their domains   
    - **transform my team to stop asking me questions**, and **instead make recommendations and ask for permission**  
    - **encourage your teammates to take more ownership** and lead their own areas    
    - like "What do you think I would say"  

* Don't look for perfection  
    - open to the differences and you accept that other people may not do things the same way you would  
    - If worried about quality, define your quality up front when you assign the task 

* **Setup some guard rails**    
    - try to **identify what information you need to feel good** about the progress, and then **the best way to get the information** without being overbearing or micromanaging the details  
        + like setup daily status meetings to go over progress, bi-weekly code reviews to go over implementation, or weekly one-on-ones with other people on the project  

* **Help them come up with a plan**   
    - **have them draft up a plan** and bring it back to you   
    - **Go over their approach together, give them feedback** (like asking good questions)  
    - When **you can draft the idea together**, you will feel more confident in their approach and they will be able to **leverage your expertise and direction**    

* **Lead them to figure it out** 
    - lead them down your steps or your thought process on how you would solve the problem, not just give them the solution  
    - **"what have you tried so far?"**  
    - "What have you considered tyring" 
    - "What did you research? Did you find anything?" 
    - "And then finally, have you tried looking up ..."" (you would look for to find the anser)
  

* **start small**   
    - start with something that is easy to do 
    - find things that maybe aren't urgent but are small, iterative improvements that would be easy introduction into your realm of responsibility
