### The Making of a Manager

-   ch1

    -   A manager is to **get better outcomes from a group of people working together**

        -   **Management is the belief that a team of people can achieve more** than a single person going it alone
        -   **help your team achieve great outcomes**

            -   half is your team's **results**
            -   the other half is based on the **strength** - hiring and developing - and **satisfaction** - happy and working well together - of my team

#### Embrace managing up

-   if you don't manage up, you'll waste time on

    -   needless back-and-forth
    -   avoidable misunderstandings
    -   confusion on how you're adding value

    -   your boss will believe you're

        -   add a ton of value
        -   worth investing in
        -   worth advocating for
        -   it's a win-win

    -   If I manage up, I'll **take control & futher my career**

-   **how to manage up**

    -   show your thought process

        -   "I recommend this because X. My criteria/assumptions were A and B.
            The potential trade-off is Y, but seems manageable because Z. I vetted a range of options [options] and found [my recommendation] best fits our needs. "

    -   **offer solutions and flag issues**

        -   "this is a problem. I suggest doing X."
        -   "This is a problem. I'm not sure how to solve, but wanted to flag it. my hunch is to monitor for now because X, but let me know if we should brainstorm what to do"

    -   Turn complaints into opportunities

        -   "This process isn't ideal because X. I'd like to update to Y process instead, which should be cheaper/faster/easier. **Do you agree if** I make the change this week?"

    -   use information hieratchy

        -   ""

    -   keep your boss in the loop

    -   control your own actions

        -   "I wonder what's making them feel the need to micromanage? I'll review how I'm keeping them informed & what success looks like so I can show i'm handling it"

    -   proactively assert what to do

        -   "I recommend X. Here's rationale, data, or examples of why this will work. The risk is Y but we can address by Z. If you agree, I'll start by doing ... "

    -   Don't only ask questions. **share your point of view too**
        -   "why? My pov is [insight]. I'm not 100% sure yet. **Curious how ya'll are thinking about it**."

#### treat your manager as a **coach**, not as a judge

-   主动向老板寻求反馈

    -   **主动问问上司**，你的哪些工作令他们印象深刻，还有哪些方面需要改进

-   定期要求与之会面，定期了解他对你的看法

-   把重点放在应该完成哪些目标上， **更好地了解管理层对自己的期望**，不仅涉及日常工作，还包括长期思维
-   自己的事情主动跟进，有什么问题就跟老板说，讨论， 如果不是自己管辖范围内的事情，别人开心就好
    这里最重要的是你对你提出的问题已经找到合适的解决方案。

-   It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes your job to help the entreprenuer **find a reasonable solution** which is merely hard and **gets most of what they wanted**. A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.

### how to mange down

-   管理 - 激励员工

    -   理解员工

        -   以员工的诉求为核心
        -   在员工内心深处，不仅**关心赚钱谋生**，还**更希望被人尊重，能体现自己的价值**，能实在地体验完成工作后的卓越感
        -   每一位员工都有理想追求，**都想实现自我价值**，并在一些领域有所建树

    -   激励的终点，是让员工自我驱动

        -   **用激励**取代控制，让员工实现自我驱动

            -   很强的控制欲
            -   授权，支持，帮助

        -   激励 是发自内心的鼓舞，认可员工价值

    -   **情境管理** 而非控制
        -   在员工日常决策中，領導不會替你做决定，他们会**利用自身信息与经验，帮你设定场景**
        -   只要**按场景假设**，感觉自己的决定符合公司利益，就可以放手去干，不用非要按领导意思来

-   your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself,even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far.
    -   your role is to **improve the purpose, people, and process of your team** to **get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcomes** as you can.

#### Giving Feedback - in a way that was helpful and direct, but also kind and thoughtful

-   **Ask first**

    -   so that the person can be mentally prepared for it ahead of time
    -   "Would you like to hear a suggestion?"
    -   "Do u mind if I give you feedback?"

    -   or start off by asking them "How do u think it went? what do u think was good, what could we improve"

-   **compliment + criticism + compliment**

    -   "The work you ... good; " + "However, ..., it might be better"

-   be timely

    -   feedback is more effective when it is at the time of the event
    -   If too much time has elasped, use judgement

-   Make it about the task, not the person

    -   like **"Adding headers to the email would make it easier to read"**

-   **Give suggestions** on how to improve

    -   tell them how - **give them examples and ideas** on how to make something better
    -   more actionable

-   Provide a personal example

    -   easier to receive is to make the recipient feel like they are not the only one making the mistake
    -   **"I learned this the hard way"** or "**I used to do the same thing**"

-   provide people **the "why"** behind your suggestions

-   Allow the person to defend/vent/explain

    -   the receiving party may react by defending or justifying their approach
    -   if that, **just listen and allow them** to say their piece
    -   more ofthen than not they will still make the changes, but **knowing that you heard their side of things will make them feel better**

-   **把事情的前因后果说清楚**， 同时明确告知需要执行的事项

#### Learning to coach and delegate

-   you are not just be the person who is the expert,
    you will be **someone who makes everyone better**

#### The art of **delegating**

-   change your mindset

    -   have to **focus on growth and education**, not necessarily efficiency.

-   Adopt a **leader:leader** model instead of a leader:follower

    -   Being a good leaders means allowing the people around you to be the experts in their domains
    -   **transform my team to stop asking me questions**, and **instead make recommendations and ask for permission**
    -   **encourage your teammates to take more ownership** and lead their own areas
    -   like "What do you think I would say"

-   Don't look for perfection

    -   open to the differences and you accept that other people may not do things the same way you would
    -   If worried about quality, define your quality up front when you assign the task

-   **Setup some guard rails**

    -   try to **identify what information you need to feel good** about the progress, and then **the best way to get the information** without being overbearing or micromanaging the details
        -   like setup daily status meetings to go over progress, bi-weekly code reviews to go over implementation, or weekly one-on-ones with other people on the project

-   **Help them come up with a plan**

    -   **have them draft up a plan** and bring it back to you
    -   **Go over their approach together, give them feedback** (like asking good questions)
    -   When **you can draft the idea together**, you will feel more confident in their approach and they will be able to **leverage your expertise and direction**

-   **Lead them to figure it out**

    -   lead them down your steps or your thought process on how you would solve the problem, not just give them the solution
    -   **"what have you tried so far?"**
    -   "What have you considered trying"
    -   "What did you research? Did you find anything?"
    -   "And then finally, have you tried looking up ..."" (you would look for to find the answer)

-   **start small**

    -   start with something that is easy to do
    -   find things that maybe aren't urgent but are small, iterative improvements that would be easy introduction into your realm of responsibility
