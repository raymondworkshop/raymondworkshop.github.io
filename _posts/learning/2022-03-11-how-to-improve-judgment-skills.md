    -   Acceptance of responsibility

    -   Perseverance

    -   **Strive for excellence**

        -   happiness comes from **the full use of one's power** to achieve excellence

        -   fill Life with **achieving and exercising excellence**

        -   **Mediocrity** can destroy us as surely as perils far more famous

##### making good decisions

-   **focus on the process** of making a decision

    -   **emotions** are crucial in helping us come to a decision
    -   need to **listen to our feelings** because we often have to live with the decisions that we have made
        -   some of **our deep-deated emotional reactions** might come from
            those aspects of **our personality that we are not able to change**
    -   **the heart** has its reasons which reason does not know

-   use a pros and cons list

    -   good reasons or good consequences

-   spend more time thinking carefully about a difficult and important decision

-   Bayesian

    -   observe -> find patterns -> create a short-cut framework -> realize your framework sucks

        -   **ask open-ended quesitons**
        -   **seeing some patterns** in the answers
        -   **make a framework from these patterns**. now I can make decisions quickly
        -   wait, this is a situation my framework does not account for, repeat

    -   **先有碎片而后不断构建框架**
        -   **不断根据新的碎片 修正甚至打破旧的框架 并构建新的框架**， 开始比较慢，但最终会后来居上
            -   先有框架后有碎片，容易上手，开始会看上去遥遥领先，但后面就僵化而无法增长
            -   框架固化后 最大坏处 是容易偏执的去 “占小便宜吃大亏”， 因为已经成为本

#### The Self-Awareness Onion

-   understanding your emotions

    -   identify blind spots in ourselves and then expressing the affected emotions appropriately
    -   **fear** -> angry, upset, worried, uninspired, sad
    -   **love**

-   ask **why we feel certain emotions**

    -   **the root cause** of the emotions that overwhelm us.
        Once we understand that root cause, we can ideally do something to change it
    -   why do you feel uninspired? why do you feel worried?  
        you failed to achieve some goal? what you consider success or failure?
    -   **引起我情緒的那些念頭都是真的嗎**？
    -   當下，**我的生命中，什麼才是真的**？
        -   我提醒自己，只有我能对自己的情绪负责，从真实发生的事情中进入当下

-   your **underlying values**

    -   if you want to change how you see your problems,
        you have to **change what you value** and **how you measure failure/success**

    -   **values-based questions** and **the metric** to assess progress toward that value

        -   why do you feel such a need to be rich in the first place?
        -   how am I choosing to measure myself?  
            By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?  
            Why do you consider this to be success/failure?

    -   define **good, healthy values**

        -   reality-based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable
        -   can be achieved internally, immediate and controllable and engage you with the world
        -   honesty (you have complete control over, reflects reality, and it benefits others), self-respect, curiosity, humility, creativity
            -   open-minded,kind, honest, positive,responsible
        -   bad values are generally reliant on **exernal events**, **outside of your control**, socially destructive or magic to achieve
            -   manipulation or violence, being liked by everybody,
                feeling good all the time, not being liked by everybody

    -   **当我们面对内心的恐惧时， 抛开“应该”**  
        然后我们就会发现“烦”随之消散，结果比我们规划的还要好

-   **Values are about prioritization**

    -   **you values determine the nature of your problems**,
        the nature of your problems determines the quality of your lives
    -   **the question is your priorities**, and that therefore **influence your decision-making**

-   reference
    -   ch4 - The Value of Suffering

#### basic rules

-   这个决定是**被爱，激情或其他正能量的东西驱动**，还是被恐惧所驱动

-   **The Golden Mean** - a balance between our rationality and our animal drives

    -   **confident yet courteous** (polite and showing respect)

        -   **knowing you're worth** and also be kind (humble and **don't look down on** others)
        -   warmth and competence

    -   **appreciate the needs of the others** while we need to **advance our own interests and concerns**

        -   **too much empathy (feeling the other person's emotions)** making deep cooperation when they're likely to be exploited

    -   Trust but verify
        -   **think carefully about what we do not want to believe**,and **what we want to believe**, before we place our trust in others
            -   **establish a baseline (what constitutes "normal" behaviors)**, and start to ask pressing questions
            -   **actively look for those clues** we hope not to find

-   **Concentration**

    -   become true to yourself
    -   **only concentrate on matters truly important to you**

-   **continually review and refine**

    -   Gradually improve your thinking until you can't be manipulated or controlled

    -   choose your friend group
        -   meet someone who has the **similar mindset & vision** as you
            is better than finding a soul mate

-   Training your boundaries to be stronger than your heart

    -   **俗文化**： 显示的比实际的要弱一些

-   **Set yourself free from fear**
    -   already been living through the worst times
    -   the freedom would empower one to face failure courageously
    -   see this as an opportunity to be a new start

#### THE Self-Awareness Onion

-   自我对话

    -   不断地问自己问题并且不接受“想当然”的答案，能够连问五次为什么的时候，
        都可以**看到我们内心深处**

-   **understanding of one's emotions**

    -   **identify blind spots** in ourselves and the **expressing the affected emotions** appropriately
    -   [2020-06-16-notes-on-the-love-skills]

-   **why we feel certain emotions**

    -   why do you fell angry? is it because you failed?
    -   help us **understand the root cause of the emothions** that overwhelm us
    -   do something to change it

-   the third level is **what you value, and how you measure failure/success**

    -   **what standard I am judging myself** and everyone around me
    -   **our values determine the nature of our problems**, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives
        -   if you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success
    -   "**why does that seem true**?"

        -   "why do I consider this to be success/failure?"
        -   " How am I choosing to measure myself?"

    -   some good values - **reality-based, socially constructive, immediate and controllable**
        -   the values are achieved **internally**, and can be experienced right now
        -   good values: honesty, curiosity, creativity, standing up for oneself,nonviolence
        -   bad values: dominance through manipulation or violence, being liked by everyone, ...

-   **why** or for what purpose?

-   self-improvement is about
    -   **prioritizing better values**, **choosing better things** to give
    -   when you give better fucks, you get better problems
    -   when you get better problems, you get a better life

##### 人生的路， 如何選擇

-   如何看待自己 - 读自我的认知

    -   经常**看自己有什么**， 而不是没有什么
    -   **多发扬自己的长处，把自己的长处和更优秀的人比**
    -   真正的成功， 是**活出自己的样子，也就是把自己的长处发挥到最大限度**

    -   **把每一次选择都作为了解自己的入口，慢慢就可以看到更多真相**

        -   视角，情绪的思考和高效的执行力
        -   有了对自己这样的认识，自信而不自负

    -   独立思考， 不断纠正自己片面的判断

        -   **学会换位思考，从多角度看问题**
        -   任何议题或政策，都要筹集足够的资讯，**分析正反两方利弊得失之后，再决定立场**

            -   即便决定立场，应该也尊重与你选择不同的人，我们都希望越来越好，只是我们想法不同而已

        -   做成熟有判断力的人
            -   任何人跟你说的话，都不要照单全收，都可能有说错的时候

-   如何看待他人 - 把每个人都看成老师和伙伴

    -   **开放的心态引导别人分享， 用有效的方式问问题**
        -   如果会问问题，就可以了解他人多年总结的有价值经验
    -   **会问问题**，这能帮助我们理解对面的人的真实需求和经验

        -   你为什么这么想？
        -   你认为最大的阻力是什么？

    -   做好自己，没有 “改变别人”的动机

-   如何看待机会和欲望

    -   **所有的决定都是微观的**， 是在具体的环境里面对具体问题做出的

        -   在每一个小选择里改变思维方式，锻炼能力，获得对应的成长
        -   **提高整体认知，选择做当下最适合自己，最值得做的事**
        -   能做多少事和你的微观环境有关
            -   **要重视，挑选和管理的，就是周围的“五六个人”**
            -   最看重的 **是否是我愿意与之一起工作的那一类人**
        -   start small, think big, experiment with ideas

    -   **通过做事来“准备”的**，而不是通过“准备”来做事的

        -   对于机会，你永远不会觉得你准备好了
        -   面对机会，没准备好不是问题，**要勇敢把握，多“做”几次就好了**  
            多做就会积累经验，提高判断力

    -   区分有效欲望
        -   通过深度自我对话， 不断追问自己“**为什么要做这件事，它有多重要，多紧急**”；
            理清不同目标的优先级

##### making good decisions

-   Concentrate on the **few important ones**

    -   the problem is **a generic situation**, and could only be solved through a decision which established a rule, a principle
    -   **clear specifications** to what the decisions has to accomplish

-   **focus on the process** of making a decision

    -   **emotions** are crucial in helping us come to a decision
    -   need to **listen to our feelings**

        -   some of **our deep-deated emotional reactions** might come from
            those aspects of **our personality that we are not able to change**
        -   **the heart** has its reasons which reason does not know

    -   put second order thinking
        -   always ask "**and then what**"
            -   think about the consequences
        -   **think through time**
            -   what do the consequences look like in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?
        -   identify your decision and think through and **write down the consequences**
            -   **review these regularly** you'll be able to help calibrate your thinking

*   How

    1.  Think about the specifications - a detailed description of how something should be done, made, etc  
        1.1 encourages **opinions** not facts (with relevance) firstly  
         1.1.1 people who voice an opinion also **take responsibility for defining what needs** to be looked at, atudied, and tested

    2.  explore the alternatives  
        2.1 find the appropriate measurement - a risk-taking judgment  
         2.1.1 look for **the 'feedback' before** the decision  
        2.2 insist on **alternatives of measurement** so that they can choose the one appropriate one  
         2.2.1 one does not make a decision unless there is disagreement

        -   **disagreement alone can provide alternatives to a decision**
        -   disagreement is needed to stimulate the **imagination** - **a new and different way of perceiving and understanding**  
            2.2.2 find out why people disagree + converned first with **understanding**
        -   use conflict of opinion as a tool to **make sure all major aspects of an important matter are looked at carefully**

    3.  the risks and gains weighted  
        3.1 act if the **benefits greatly outweight cost and risk**  
        3.2 **act or do not act**; no half-action

    4.  Do not rush into a decision unless you are sure **you understand it**

    5.  A decision requires **courage** as much as it requires **judgment**

-   use a pros and cons list

    -   good reasons or good consequences

-   spend more time thinking carefully about a difficult and important decision
