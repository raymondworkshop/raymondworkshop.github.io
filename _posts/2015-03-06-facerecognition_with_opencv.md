#### Some ideas and approachments

#### geometric feature
* marker points ( position of eyes, ears, noses, ...) are used to build the feature vector (the distance, the angle, ...)

#### Eigenfaces
* The idea is that a facial image is a point from a high-dim image space, and a high-dim dataset is often described by correlated variables and therefore only a few meaningful dim account for most of the information .

* alg
    - [PCA] [2] alg finds the lower-dim subspace with maximum variance (with the mean) in data.  ( that is, to turn a set of possibly correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables) .

    - There is a TRICK here in computing the eigenvectors: a M x N matrix with M > N can only have N - 1 non-zero eigenvalues, so we can take the eigenvalue decomposition S of size N x N instead .

    - The approach maximizes the total scatter, but if the variance is generated by an external source like light, components with a maximum variance over all classes aren't nessarily useful for classification.

* The [API] [3] in OpenCV:
    - Ptr<FaceRecognizer> createEigenFaceRecognizer(int num_components, double threshold)
            (~\sources\modules\contrib\src\facerec.cpp)
        + Perform the PCA
        + (~\modules\core\src\matmul.cpp)
          pca(data, Mat(), CV_PCA_DATA_AS_ROW, _num_components)

          The parameter *num_components* means that how many principal components to retain (it is not  larger than the number of training samples) .

        + Get the feature vectors (y here is the principal component )
          Mat y = subspaceProject(_eigenvectors, _mean, data.row(sampleIdx)

          The parameter *threshold* here gives a upper distance limit in the prediction (It is the parameter *minDist* in the  Eigenfaces::predict())

           Eigenfaces::predict(InputArray _src, int &minClass, double &minDist)
           
          Each test sample is projected into PCA subspace,and get the related label based on the NORM_L2 distance in the trained subspace.


#### Fisherfaces

#### Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH)
* idea
    - The focus is only on extracting local features of an object, thus the features in this waywill have a low-dim implicitly.

    - Also, the local description has to be a bit robust against image illumination variations (things like scale,translation or rotation), so the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) is given to summarize the local structure in a image by comparing each pixel with its neighborhood .

* The [API] [3] in OpenCV
  Ptr<FaceRecognizer> createLBPHFaceRecognizer(int radius,int neighbors, int grid_x, int grid_y, double threshold) Calculate lbp image

    -  elbp(src[sampleIdx],_radius,_neighbors)

      The parameters *radius* and *neighbors* are used in the local binary pattern creation

    - Get spatial histogram from this lbp image
``` c++
      Mat p = spatial_histogram(
                lbp_image, /* lbp_image */
                static_cast<int>(std::pow(2.0, static_cast<double>(_neighbors))), /* number of possible patterns */
                _grid_x, /* grid size x */
                _grid_y, /* grid size y */
                true)
```

      The parameters *gird_x* and *grid_y* control the grid size of the spatial histograms.
              At last the feature vectors (p here is the spatial histogram) are given .

      LBPH::predict(InputArray _src, int &minClass, double &minDist)
          
      compareHist(_histograms[sampleIdx], query, CV_COMP_CHISQR)

      Chi-square test is used for the distance measure

#### The Performance

* Receiver operating characteristic ( [ROC]  )
    - A ROC space is defined by TAR (I.e., the rate of genuine attempts accepted) and FAR(I.e., the rate of impostor attempts accepted) as y and x axes respectively, which depicts relative trade-offs between true positive (benefits) and false positive (costs).

* Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC)
    - It plots the probability of identification against the returned 1:N candidate list size. It shows the probability that a given user appears in different sized candidate lists.
