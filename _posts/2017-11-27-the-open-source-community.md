#### Unix Standards 

Unix standards originally developed to reconcile the APIs of the different branches of the family tree. 

Later, during the Unix wars, **technical standardization** became something that cooperating technical people pushed for and most product managers accepted grudgingly or actively resisted.

In fact, on the the newer open-source Unixes (such as Linux) it is common for operating system features to have been engineered **using published standards as the specification**.


#### RFC (A Request for Comments ) Standard

The IETF Standards process is designed to encourage standarization **driven by practice rather than theory**, and to ensure that standard protocols have undergine **rigorous peer review and testing**.

**The IETF (The Internet Engineering Task Force)** Standards Process: 
> Internet-Drafts (focal points for discussion in a working group)  
> -> RFC (correct field experience with the specification)  
> -> Proposed Standards (the specification must be stable, peer-reviewed, and significants interests)  
> -> Draft Standard (the specification is mature and will be useful)  
> -> Internet Standard  


#### Specifications as DNA, code as RNA

The Unix tradition's emphasis on **modularity makes Unix programmers usually to scrap and rebuild**. The IETF tradition teaches us to think of code as secondary to standards.  The IETF showed us that **careful standardization is to capture the best of existing practice**.  

Experience, and a strong tradition of collaborative development, had already taught Unix programmers that **prototyping and repeated cycles of test and re-specification** are a better way.  

This **standards-come-first scrap-and-rebuild culture** of Unix tends to yield better interoperability over extended time than **perpetual patching of a code base without a standard** or to provide guidance and continuity.


#### Open standards and Open source

**Open-source implementations of a published standard** can both tremendously reducing your coding workload. With open-source code, you have a path forward, because you have access to source code, you can forward-port it to new platforms if you need to .

Practice defensive design - build on open source.


#### Documentation - Explaining your code to A web-centric World

#### Open Source - Programming in the Unix Community 

Most contributors in Open-source development are **volunteers contributing** in order to be **rewarded by the increased usefulness of the software to them**, and by **reputation incetives**, thus **Process transparency and peer review** are the crucial steps in the open-source development.
