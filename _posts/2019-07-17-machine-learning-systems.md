#### digging for requirements 

* what exactly is the business objective?  
    - how does the company expect to use and benefit from this model?  

#### workflow to Approach a ML problem -> Prototype 

* what kind of **question or goal** we wanna answer  

* how to **define and measure success** -> like using a business metric like increased profit or decreased losses  

* acquire the data and build a working prototype  - a loop [TODO] 
    - analyze the mistakes 
    - collect more or diff data 
    - change the task formulation slightly  

* humans in the loop 
    - algotithms might increase response time or reduce cost 
    - TODO 

#### From Prototype to Production 

* data analytics teams 
* production teams -> reimplement the solution for robust, scalable system 
    - offline evaluation 
    - online testing using A/B testing
