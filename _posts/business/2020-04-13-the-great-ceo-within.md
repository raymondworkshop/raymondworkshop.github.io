- 维持创造者思维， creation is about building
    - 维持创造者思维，专注于 **将脑中的想法转变为可工作的最小实现**的过程
    - **an app is an act of self-expression**, the same way a novel, a painting, a lego starship, or a gourmet meal is
        - The difference is you can distribute your app to millions of people from your spare room over a phone line, so **the potential impact of your creation is enormous**
        - you can do the same with a blog post or an ebook, but a software app is a utility as well as a work of art. If you make a great one, **it can become an intimate part of your users' everyday life**, like their fork or belt.

- learn how to **propose better solutions**
    - the first thing you should do is **define the problem**,
      **your idea** for the solution, **your target user base**
    - **Do your research**. **know all the existing solutions out there**,
      and **exactly how your spec is different and better**

    - start mocking up screens. Get in deep

    - **defining great specifications** is a more important part of creating digital tools than writing the code itself
        - **what your one-sentence description will be** when your app appears in a store
