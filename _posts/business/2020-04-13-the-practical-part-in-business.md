#### notes  
* lessons    
    - **focus on developing and cultivating your plan**,
    when **you have your plan** and **you can feel it's right** for you  
        + what others are doing won't matter  
        + comparison dies when **your vision becomes clear**  
        + concentrate your energy on what you're doing    


    - **do everything manually first to get started**  
    and then build software to automate everything second **for scale**  

    -  **practical ability** is more important       

    - the ultimate hack to become rich, **own a business**   

    - if you want to be wealthy, **spend your time earning, learning, or relaxing**; **oursource or ignore everything else**    

    - **Using creativity to solve problems** cannot be taught, and it's ultimately what free markets pay for  
        + **invest your creativity, skills and efforts into solving big problems** and you will receive big rewards  
        + if the work doesn't require **creativity**, **delegate it, automate it, or leave it**  

    - it's **leveraged versus un-leveraged**    
        + forget rich versus poor, white-collar versus blue  
        + **code, media,  capital, labor**    


    - 商人玩的是 **赚钱的游戏**  
        + **尽可能避免零和游戏**，因为它并不创造财富；多元化机会  
            - treat people as friends and **attempt to win together**   
            rather than to treat people as enemies and attempt to win on your own  

        + 商业利益 就应该 **最大比例考虑商业利益**  
        除非威胁到 健康/人身安全，家人，自由等等； 原则倒是其次    
        + 多数中国人比较熟悉 “**实用主义驱动的经济自由化**”  
            - **在稳定的利益基础上建立的合作**觉得才是稳固的，人品和情谊都无法提供这种稳定性  

    - 商业和熟人的模式不一样  
        + **家人是支持对方**    
        + 你把你自己的利益放在团体利益之上  
        + if something is free, realize **you are the payment**  
            - **you pay with time and sanity** for the majority of the free offers   

    - 专注于**赚钱的项目**，而不是被理想催着走  
        + 大多数人从未创造或发布过任何东西，所以发布本事就是一个值得庆祝的大事  

    - **pass the basic boring step** firstly, then the creative part will come    


* **practical part**    
    - 在熊市中， **信念**，**江湖义气**（组织），运气， 一点点钱  

    - understand **the desired business outcomes and goals**  
    
    - **intuition**  
        + (knowledge from) an ability to understand or know something immediately based on your **feelings** rather than facts  

        + **listen to your body and the signals** 
            - **establish the observing self and its capacity** to achieve a calm, detached state where you can better identify what is going on
                + **Inner calm fosters true intuition** and allows it to be easily identified  
                + Create an inner clamness by **focusing on her breath**; when worries arise, you can **examine them from this calm state**.  
                    - "what is this worry?"  
                    - "**where am I feeling it** in my body?"  
                    - "**how important** is this worry in the big picture of life?"  

                + when your worries arise, **just lets them pass-by without responding** emotionally or intellectually  

            - separate  true intuition from **wishful thinking** (what we hope will happen) or **projections** (interpreting images through the lens of our own history or ideas)  
                + wishful thinking and projection are filled with your history, your hopes, your ideas, and your wounds

                + write your answers down to these questions  
                    - "is this an image or a sensation from my past?"  
                    - "did I see or expereince something like this in the movies/book"  
                    - "does this image have anything to do with my fears or worries?"  
                    - "how much do I wish that this image would come true?"
