                rather than to treat people as enemies and attempt to win on your own

        -   商业利益 就应该 **最大比例考虑商业利益**  
            除非威胁到 健康/人身安全，家人，自由等等； 原则倒是其次

        -   多数中国人比较熟悉 “**实用主义驱动的经济自由化**”

            -   **在稳定的利益基础上建立的合作**觉得才是稳固的，人品和情谊都无法提供这种稳定性

        -   商业模式，本质上是**可以双赢的权力游戏**
            -   比如一个产品服务，从一个客户到十个客户，因为边际成本低，可以讲价，让大家受益

    -   商业和熟人的模式不一样

        -   **家人是支持对方**
        -   你把你自己的利益放在团体利益之上

            -   **establish the observing self and its capacity** to achieve a calm, detached state where you can better identify what is going on

                -   **Inner calm fosters true intuition** and allows it to be easily identified
                -   Create an inner clamness by **focusing on her breath**; when worries arise, you can **examine them from this calm state**.

                    -   "what is this worry?"
                    -   "**where am I feeling it** in my body?"
                    -   "**how important** is this worry in the big picture of life?"

                -   when your worries arise, **just lets them pass-by without responding** emotionally or intellectually

            -   separate true intuition from **wishful thinking** (what we hope will happen) or **projections** (interpreting images through the lens of our own history or ideas)

                -   wishful thinking and projection are filled with your history, your hopes, your ideas, and your wounds

                -   write your answers down to these questions
                    -   "is this an image or a sensation from my past?"
                    -   "did I see or expereince something like this in the movies/book"
                    -   "does this image have anything to do with my fears or worries?"
