#### ch7 Before the project 
* digging for requirements 
    - make the requirement **the general statement** , and give the developers the policy information as an example 

    - discover the **underlying reason why** users do a particular, rather than just the way 
      + **documenting the reasons** behind requirements 
      + your dev has to **solve the business problem**, not just meet the stated requirements 

    - propose the **concept of use cases** as a basis for discussions - the developers, the end users, and project sponsors 

    - requirements are need 
      + accurately reflects the business need 

      + **capture the underlying semantic invariants as requirements**, and document the **specific as policy** 

      + **abastractions live longer than details** 

#### The Pragmatic Approach 
* The evails of duplication adn othrogonality


#### The basic tools  - **tools** amplify your talent
* Invest in your own basic toolbox
    
* Plain Text is that standard
    Our base material is **knowledge**. We express that knowledge in our designs, implementations, test, and documents. The best format for storing knowledge persistently is **plain text**.
    
* Power editing 
    Using one Editor could manipulate text as effortlessly as possible. we should know it very well, and use it for **all editing tasks**.  
      
* Debugging - **fix the problem**, not the blame
     - debugging is **just problem solving**, and attack it as such
     - visualize the data -> get a good look at the data it is operating on
     - Tracing -> the state of a program or a data structure over time 
     - Don't assume it, **prove it**; and how to improve it 
     - master one text manipulation language
