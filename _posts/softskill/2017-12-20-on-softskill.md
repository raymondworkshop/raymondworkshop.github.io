    - **follow the host**  
    - greet first before asking any question

#### 如何处理和伯乐的关系 
  * 因为年龄，性别和阅历的差别，或者还没有见面的人，
    - **应该保持一定的距离感**， 不能像平辈好友一样随便， 给人举止轻浮的感觉  
    - **让对方知道你的尊敬，感激之情** 
    - 开始上班后给对方**汇报一下自己的感受和进展** 
    - **让对方参与到你的事业发展中来**，这样很自然地增强了这种导师的指导关系

  * 第一次联系的时候，**礼貌地就是论事请教对方** 
    - 建立初步联系后，可以再补充问一些问题  

  * 如何在第一次联系当中就给对方好感呢？  
    - 首先**学会放低自己，谦虚的学习态度**, 因为是要获取对方的信息和分享
    - **不要让对方产生竞争或威胁的感觉**
