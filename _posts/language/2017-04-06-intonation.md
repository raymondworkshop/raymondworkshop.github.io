#### tips  
* stress 
  - focus on **stress and 'feeling'**   
  - stress relates to rhythm and intonation    
  - think about not just individual sounds but also
  **think about the overall feeling of the sentence**.   

* study mouths movement  
* repetition   

#### pitch 
* **raised the pitch** for the stress words, and **dropped it at the end**, and played with the level so every syllable was **a little higher or a little lower** than previous word . 

* Intonation - emojis 
  - understand the hidding meaning 
  - 
  - GPS or mapping 
  - "that was good" - rise, fall, and rise 
  - "that was good" - rise, **falling at the end** <- negative
