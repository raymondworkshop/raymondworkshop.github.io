#### distributed representations of words
word2vec is a class of neural network models, trained on unlabelled trainign corpus, that produce a vector for each word in the corpus that encode its valuable syntactic and  semantic informaton .


#### Skip-grams (SG) - predict context words given target (position independent)

#### Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) - Predict target word from bag-of-words context
 

#### Stochastic Gradient Descent
