Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong. I am an Engineer and Founder@Bean based in Hong Kong.  
I like building ourselves, products, and teams.

I was a Tech Officer at HSUHK, RA in (CUHK, CityU, and HKBU), Tech Lead at HKCREO (a Fintech startup), and Lead Software Engineer at Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia Corporation).

I got my MSc in Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong and BEng in Electronic and Information Engineering at WuHan University.

You can see some of my projects [here](https://github.com/raymondworkshop). If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at **bestraymond@icloud.com**. I’d be happy to hear from you.

Outside of tech and [reading](https://raymondworkshop.github.io/bookshelf.html), I like Philosophy, Nature, and Art.

Some of My favorite quotes:

-   "The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge" - Bertrand Russell
-   "Buy yourself cake and flowers and get through it. "
-   "It’s never too late to be what you might have been" - George Eliot
-   "No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it" - Albert Einstein
-   "Live a life created for you, instead of the life you create"
