Hi, I'm _muyun, a Computer Engineer & Scientist based in Hong Kong.   
<br>     

I like problem solving, and reading.  I write at [blog.reader](https://muyun.github.io/).    
<br> 

If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at wenlzhao [at] gmail [dot] com. I’d be happy to hear from you. 
I am also available for project consulting.  You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_muyun).
<br> <br> 

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-development, and experiencing something such as local cultures, nature, and art. 
<br> <br> 

I worked as Technical Officer at HSUHK, RA at CityU and HKBU, Software Engineer at HKCREO (a Fintech startup) and Alcatel-Lucent S. A. (Nokia Corporation now).   
I have a BS in Electroic and Information Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://www.sciencemag.org/collections/celebrating-125-years-academic-excellence-wuhan-university-1893-2018?fbclid=IwAR0RzFSkpxaI8wk61JDnE7p6SWr7SlKXLyoFHkrg4-iqKGiRyE2gZfaGl8s), and a MS in Computer Science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).
