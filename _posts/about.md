Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong. I am an Engineer and Founder@Bean in Hong Kong.
I like building products, teams, and ourselves.

I was a Technology Officer in HSUHK, RA in (CUHK, CityU, and HKBU), Tech Lead at HKCREO (a Fintech startup), and Lead Software Engineer Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia Corporation) .

I got my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong and B.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering at WuHan University.

You can see some of my project [here](https://github.com/raymondworkshop). If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at **bestraymond@icloud.com**. I’d be happy to hear from you.

I do a lot of [reading](https://raymondworkshop.github.io/bookshelf.html).
Outside of tech, I like Philosophy and Art.
