Hi, I'm _muyun, a Computer Engineer & Scientist, and Product Manager.   
<br>     

I like problem solving, and reading.  I write at [blog.reader](https://muyun.github.io/).    
<br> 

You can find some of my projects [here](https://github.com/muyun). If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss, send me a mail at wenlzhao@gmail.com,
I’d like to hear from you.   
<br> <br> 

Outside of Technology & Philosophy world, I also like self-development, and experiencing something such as nature, local cultures, and art. 
<br> <br> 

You can support my open work by tipping me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/muyun), or send me BTC at 19YGkJm3QTARcpatbdUdmYy8ZuDLZ91nr3 .
