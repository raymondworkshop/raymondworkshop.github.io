<h5>情绪管理</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>觉察情绪</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>情绪<ul>
<li>“与哥哥吵完架后， <strong>现在有什么感觉</strong>？”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>观点<ul>
<li>“担心的<strong>原因是什么</strong>？”</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>渴望 - 动机<ul>
<li>“<strong>你这样做想满足的渴望是什么</strong>？ 请从'爱人，被爱，被尊重，被接纳，有自由，有意义' 中选择”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>面对情绪</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>情绪视为一个能帮助我们找到方向的信使</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>情绪会指引我们如何面对这些消息，进而采取对我们有利的行动</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>对情绪命名</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>将“我这个人”</strong> 和 <strong>“我的情绪” 分开</strong></li>
<li>我或许“不喜欢这个情绪”， 但这并不等于我“不喜欢我这个人”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>接受情绪</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>情绪告诉你为何有此情绪 - 情绪背后的观点<ul>
<li><strong>将“我这个人”</strong> 和 <strong>“我的情绪” 分开</strong></li>
<li>"<strong>我之所以会有这个情绪，是因为</strong> ..."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>也告诉你接下来该做些什么 - 情绪背后的期待<ul>
<li>"<strong>接下来我会想做些什么</strong> ..."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>处理情绪</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>加入理性思考 - <strong>利弊得失加入考量后</strong>，才决定要采取什么行动</p>
<ul>
<li>评估你的情绪背后的<strong>观点是否有所根据</strong></li>
<li>评估你的情绪背后的<strong>期待是否务实可行</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>你收到了情绪想要传达的讯息</strong>，但是又不让情绪来掌控你，而是<strong>你掌控情绪</strong>，<strong>做出最能够解决问题的理性选择</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>放下情绪</p>
<ul>
<li>欢喜做<ul>
<li>这是<strong>我经过充分的觉察自己的各种观点与期待之后所做出的选择</strong>， 而不是没有经过选择的反射式反应</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>甘愿受<ul>
<li><strong>既然这是我的选择</strong>，<strong>所以不管结果如何</strong>，<strong>我都会承担起责任</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>情绪系统</p>
<ul>
<li>想要避免没有处理好情绪所带来的后果</li>
<li>
<p><strong>每种情绪都对我们有帮助</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>喜<ul>
<li>期待得到满足</li>
<li>指引 - 享受，分享，再努力</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>怒</strong><ul>
<li>被攻击/侵犯， 期待落空时</li>
<li>防卫，攻击，指责，要求</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>哀<ul>
<li>失落，无能为力</li>
<li>疗伤，预防，求助</li>

<li>碰到危险或未知的状况时</li>
<li>逃离</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>后天学习和环境 影响我们对 情绪的应对</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>处理情绪只能疏导</strong>， 不能围堵</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>转化情绪模式</strong> - 面对，接受，处理情绪</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>对情绪的敏感度</strong>， 觉察自己的内在冰山</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>当 ... (情境)的时候</strong>，
    <strong>我感觉 ... （情绪）</strong>，
    <strong>（因为） 我认为 ... (观点)</strong>，
    <strong>我希望 ... (期待)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>平衡 感性 和 理性</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>由情绪出发</strong>，然后加入理性考量才做出最后的反应<ul>
<li><strong>情绪是与生俱来的</strong>， <strong>而观点则是后天学习而来的</strong>， 也就是观点是‘社会’要我们遵守的规则（观点）</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>忽律了感性的指引，也就是忽略了自己的需求</strong><ul>
<li>感性 - 反射式 - reactive<ul>
<li>只跟随自己的情绪走，而忽略了社会化的规则</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>理性 - 机械式反应 - robotic<ul>
<li>一味遵从权威人士所定的规则， 而<strong>忽略了自己的情绪想告诉你的讯息</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>表达自己的情绪时</strong>， 还要能<strong>兼顾 “自己”， “他人”， “情境”</strong> 三要素， 才能一更具“一致性”</p>
<ul>
<li>当我看到你的报告时 （事件），
    我感觉很失望 （情绪），
    因为我认为这不是你平常的水准（观点），
    我希望你重做这个报告（期待）</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch7 <strong>转化情绪模式</strong> - 练习放下情绪</p>
<ul>
<li>一致性 在于一个人所展现的行为， <strong>是否为 有觉察，有意识下</strong>的作为<ul>
<li><strong>一致性并不代表永远说真话</strong></li>
<li><strong>如果经过充分的觉察</strong>，<strong>考量怎么做会对自己好，对他人好，也有助于达成你想要的目标</strong>， 然后有意识地做出“像似” 讨好，指责，超理智，打岔的反应，也是一致性</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding peace from mind</p>
<ul>
<li>the moments of greatest pleasure<ul>
<li>that voice in your head goes silent, it calms down</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>our mind evolved to be paranoid, fearful and angry<ul>
<li>natural is brutal. We did it through fear, violence and cooperation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>our evolved nature rewards pessimism<ul>
<li>modern society's a lot safer and more peaceful</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind is great at learning and solving problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heart talks to US through joy &amp; LOVE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heart loves YOU exactly the way you are</strong>.
    <strong>It doesn't matter if</strong> you trip and fall on your shoelaces or burn the banana bread.</li>
<li>Heart is great at being in the HERE and NOW</li>
<li><strong>Heart can tell Mind that it will love without any judgment</strong><ul>
<li><strong>If heart feels the spark to dance</strong>, but Mind thinks that it will look silly since it is not a REAL dancer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind will hold Heart's hand and take one step in any direction until <strong>they know what Heart wants</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy where you are right now. Because right now is your greatest gift. That's why we call it The present</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice <strong>listening to your heart</strong> and <strong>use your mind to take action</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>close your eyes, and <strong>take some deep breaths</strong></li>
<li><strong>Let thoughts and mental pictures pass by</strong>; <strong>Allow yourself to relax</strong></li>
<li>ask your heart, "<strong>What do U want to do right now</strong>?"<ul>
<li>Ideas from your heart can <strong>come through as words, images, feelings, or a joyful burst of action</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wait and listen for a response</strong></li>
<li>Use your mind to take action</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Awareness is a tool we use to understand Mind and Heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's like <strong>a light that helps us see what is real</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breathing helps Mind to stop worrying</strong> about yesterday or tomorrow and instead, be in the HERE and NOW</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>How to reliease a stormy ycloud</p>
<ul>
<li>close your eyes and breathe in and breathe out</li>
<li><strong>bring your attention to your body</strong></li>
<li><strong>what does it feel like? Mad? Sad? Hurt?</strong></li>
<li>Focus your awareness and keep breathing</li>
<li>Keep going until the cloud has floated away</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind knows that if the clouds come back, <strong>Heart and Awareness are always by its side</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The heavy thoughts and feelings like clouds that come and go</strong> and sometimes block the sun</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Being or thinking</strong>?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you're feeling sth, <strong>bring in your awareness to check out where the feeling is coming from</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Being -&gt; Feeling -&gt; Intuitive Sparks -&gt; Inspired Action</strong> - Heart</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathe in and breathe out</strong>; <strong>Close your eyes and clear you mind</strong>.
    You'll <strong>start to sense an energy within you and around you</strong>.
    <strong>It feels elevating, expansive, and really nice</strong>.
    This sensation is not there due to a thought in the mind.
    <strong>When you have cleared your awareness from the mind</strong>, <strong>you are simply being</strong>.
    And <strong>in this simplicity of being</strong>, you <strong>find a deep sense of peace</strong>.
    And in this deep sense of peace, you will start to <strong>sense greater sensations of joy, love, and freedom</strong>. And <strong>here lies the heart</strong>. Where, <strong>regardless of the 'situation' you're in now, you still feel great</strong>. But, the feeling didn't come from a thought. The feeling came from being.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking -&gt; Feeling - Mind</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The feeling is a direct result of the mind thinking</strong>.
    And the feeling from the thoughts continue to lead to more thoughts that match the level of the feeling.</li>

<h4>Soul vs Ego</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The ego lives in fear</strong> and <strong>the soul lives in love</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the ego is a person's sense of <strong>self-importance</strong>; it is your social mask;
    <strong>your social mask thrives on approval</strong>. It wants control, and it is sustained <strong>by power</strong>, because it lives in fear.</li>
<li>our ego was 'created' to keep us safe. It is <strong>a shield that protects our true emotions</strong>
    we need to do this because of a lack of <strong>trust</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>how is <strong>big ego different from confidence</strong>, and loving ourselves?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>whether our soul is present or not</strong></li>
<li>when someone's ego is too big, we categorise them as being selfish and solely focused on themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>impossible for both the ego and the soul to be working at the same time</p>
<ul>
<li>each and everything we do feeds one of them</li>
<li>it is up to us to <strong>recognize which one is present and when</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>in each decision you make, ask yourself <strong>is this my ego or my soul talking</strong></p>
<ul>

<p>ch1</p>
<ul>
<li>To be aware that <strong>you are watching</strong> the mind talks<ul>
<li>You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense making you feel more secure.
    As long as that's what you want, you will be forced to <strong>constantly use your mind to buffer yourself</strong> from life, instead of living it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Come to know the one</strong> who watches the voice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch2</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There's a <strong>separation between you and the anger of the jealousy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The first is you</strong>, <strong>the awareness</strong>, <strong>the witness</strong>, <strong>the center of your willful intentions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The other is that which you watch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just be aware of it</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sit inside yourself for a while</strong> in complete solitude and silence</li>
<li>you're so close that you don't realize that <strong>you're actually hypnotized into listening to the voice</strong></li>
<li><strong>if you could get rid of the voice</strong>, the peace and serenity would be the nicest vacation you're ever had</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>you'll never be free of problems until <strong>you are free from the part within</strong> that has so many problems</p>
<ul>
<li>"<strong>What part of me is being disturbed</strong> by this?";
    "What part of me is jealous?"</li>
<li>
<p>"<strong>who notices this inner</strong> disturbance?"</p>
<ul>
<li>To attain true inner freedom, you must be able to <strong>objectively watch your problems</strong> instead of being lost in them</li>
<li>No solution can possibly exist while you're lost in the energy of a problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>go inside and <strong>let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you do that, you'll be clear enough to deal with what's left</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit yourself to the inner work of freedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche.
    You have to take it back</li>
<li><strong>distance yourself from your voice, psyche</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This is Your life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stand firm in the seat of the witness</strong> and <strong>release the hold</strong> that the habitual mind has on you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your will is stronger than the habit</strong> of listening to that voice.
    <strong>There is nothing you can't do</strong>. <strong>Your will is supreme</strong> over all of this.</p>

<p>Who are You</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I am the one who sees</strong>.
    I look out, and I am aware of the events, thoughts, and emotions that pass before me</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When you just look without creating thoughts</strong>, your consciousness is effortlessly aware of, and fully comprehends, all that it sees</p>
<ul>
<li>the is your soul/self - <strong>awareness, consciousness, and intuitive sense of existence</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You are behind everything</strong>, Just watching</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>sit far enough back inside to see</strong> all <strong>your thoughts and emotions</strong> , as well as outer form</li>
<li><strong>All of these objects are in front of you</strong> . The thoughts are closer in, the emotions are a little further away, and form is way out there. Behind it all, there you are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <strong>live in the seat of consciousness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the seat, you are aware that there are <strong>thoughts, emotions, and a world coming in</strong> through your senses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch4</p>
<ul>
<li>meditation<ul>
<li>you must not only have the ability to <strong>focus your consciousness completely on one object</strong>,
    you must also have the ability to make awareness itself be that object</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You just <strong>happen to be watching one</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The world is just something you're watching</strong>
    <strong>The more you are willing to just let the world be sth you're aware of</strong>,
    <strong>the more it will let you be who you are - the Soul, the Self</strong></li>
<li><strong>Instead of just focusing on intently on this one human being's thoughts, emotions, and sensory world</strong>, <strong>you can pull back and see everything</strong>. <strong>You can move from the finite to the infinite</strong>.
    this is what Christ, buddha try to tell us.</li>

<p>you don't feel <strong>this energy when you close your heart or close your mind</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spiritual energy</strong> - Spirit - is what you're experiencing when love rushes up into your heart</p>
<ul>
<li>this flow of energy comes from the depth of your being</li>
<li>we are programmed based on our past impressions such that all kinds of things can cause us to open and close</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace life with all your heart and soul</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No matter what it is</strong>, it's beautiful when you feel that way inside<ul>

<p><strong>Enjoy all of life</strong>. <strong>Dare to be different</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As long as you are defining what you like and what you don't like, you will open and close.
    You are actually defining your limits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You become a source of light</strong> for all those around you</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>people can pick up on your energy</strong>, and you're feeding them with this flow</li>
<li>if you love life, nothing is worth closing over</li>

<p>You are the <strong>experiencer of your spiritual heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You feel the heart's energy all the time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>what it is like to feel love in your heart</li>
<li>what it is like to feel inspiration and enthusiasm pour from your heart</li>
<li>what it is like to feel energy well up in your heart making you confident and strong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All of the different things happen because the heart goes through changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we <strong>fall in love if the heart</strong> opens; the love stops if the heart closes</li>
<li>if the heart happens to <strong>hurt, we get angry</strong></li>
<li>if we stop <strong>feeling it altogether, we get empty</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All the inner noise is just your attempt to process the blocked energy</strong> and get it out of the way</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>truly amazing to step back and look at this process</strong><ul>
<li>As you willfully struggle to keep these events from passing through your consciousness,
    <strong>the energy first tries to release by manifesting through the mind</strong>. it <strong>then tries to release through the heart</strong>. <strong>That is what creates all the emotional activity</strong>.
    <strong>When you resist even that release</strong>, the energy gets packed up and forced into deep storage within the heart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you are <strong>wasting precious energy by blocking the flow through resisting and clinging</strong><ul>
<li><strong>those that cause either problems or some sense of enjoyment</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoy life instead of clinging to it or pushing it away</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you can live like this, each moment will change you</strong>.
    If you are <strong>willing to experience the gift of life</strong> instead of fighting with it,
    you will <strong>be moved to the depth of your being</strong>.</li>
<li>when you reach this state, you will begin to see the secrets of the heart.<ul>
<li><strong>The heart is the place through which energy flows to sustain you</strong>. This energy inspires you and raises you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Just open</strong>, <strong>relax your heart</strong>, <strong>forgive</strong>, <strong>smile</strong>, or <strong>do anything you want</strong><ul>
<li>Just don't push it back down</li>
<li><strong>be willing to let it go</strong> when it gets stimulated. <strong>It only hurts for a minute and then it's over</strong><ul>
<li>when that light blue Mustang drives by and <strong>you feel fear or jealousy</strong>, <strong>just smile</strong>.
    <strong>Be happy that</strong> this Samskara, which has been stored down there for all this time, <strong>has the opportunity to make it through you</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><strong>Simply allow the experiences of life to come in and pass through your being</strong></p>

<p><strong>stop fighting it</strong>, they'll come up constantl yand pass right through you</p>

<p><strong>Your reward is a permanently open heart</strong></p>

<p>You are <strong>protecting your ego</strong>, <strong>your self-concept</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>close down the centers to <strong>avoid being too sensitive to the different energies coming in and causing fear</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you close and protect yourself</strong>, <strong>insecure person within your heart</strong>. <strong>You will never grow</strong></li>
<li>Living like this allows for very little spontaneous joy, enthusiasm, and excitement for life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No matter how much pain the exposure</strong> creates, you are <strong>willing to pay that price for freedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How often do U find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part</strong> of you?
    <strong>You start by watching life</strong> and <strong>noticing the constant flow of people and situations that hit your stuff</strong> every day</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reward for not protecting your psyche is <strong>liberation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are free to walk through this world without a problem on your mind</strong>.
    <strong>you are just having fun experiencing</strong> whatever happens next. <strong>Because you got rid of that scared part of you</strong>, you don't ever have to worry about getting hurt.</li>
<li><strong>You just go about your business</strong> and <strong>put your whole being into whatever's happening</strong>, instead of putting your whole being into your personal sensitivity.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><strong>Your growth takes place</strong> onece you've <strong>made the commitment to free yourself of that scared person inside</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You notice a emotion or thought emerges</strong>, <strong>relax behind it</strong>. <strong>Don't judge it</strong>, <strong>don't try to change it</strong>.</li>
<li>if you <strong>use your inner willpower to not go with it</strong>, and just remain seated within.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>you decide to use life to free yourself</strong>. <strong>You become willing to pay any price for the freedom of your soul</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A wise person remains centered enough to <strong>let go every time the energy shifts into a defensive mode</strong>. The moment the energy moves and <strong>you feel your consciousness start to get drawn into it</strong>, you <strong>relax and release</strong>. <strong>Falling behind the energy</strong> instead of going into it. It just takes a moment of <strong>conscious effort to decide that you're not going there</strong>. You just let go.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter what others do, <strong>unless you decide that it matters to you</strong>.
    Only you can take inner freedom away from yourself or give it to yourself.</li>

<li>or <strong>as your consciousness gets immersed in the disturbance</strong>, you lose your clear seat of Self</li>

<p><strong>Open your heart</strong>, and <strong>let it go as you're aware that you didn't</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>You can <strong>look deep within yourself</strong>, <strong>to the core of your being</strong>,
    and <strong>decide that you don't want the weakest part of you running your life</strong><ul>
<li>You wanna talk to people because you find them interesting, not because you're lonely</li>
<li>you wanna have relationships with people because you genuinely like them, not because you need for them to like you</li>
<li>you wanna love because you truly love, not because you need to avoid your inner problem</li>

<p>you <strong>free yourself by finding yourself</strong></p>

<p><strong>Stop playing with them</strong>.
    If you want, you can simply <strong>permit the disturbances to come up</strong>, and you can <strong>let them go</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What you can do is <strong>notice that you notices</strong>.
    You <strong>notice it is watching your inner melodrama</strong>.
    <strong>Notice who it is that feels</strong> the loneliness. The one who notices is already free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you maintain your center, you can <strong>learn to appreciate and respect even the difficult experiences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>See it feel jealousy, need, and fear</strong>; They are <strong>just sth you're feeling and experiencing</strong>.
    You are the indwelling being that is aware of all of this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be an explorer</strong>. <strong>Witness it</strong>, and <strong>then it will go</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notice and just watch how experiencing loneliness affects you</strong>.
    Does your <strong>posture</strong> change? Do you <strong>breathe</strong> slower or faster?
    <strong>What goes on</strong> when loneliness is given the space it needs to pass through you?</li>
<li>If you don't get absorbed in it, <strong>the experience will soon pass</strong> and <strong>sth else will come up</strong>.
    <strong>Just enjoy all of it</strong>. If you can do this, you will be free, and <strong>a world of pure energy will open up within you</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experience if you hang out with the SELF</strong> instead of hanging out with inner disturbances</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sit comfortably deep inside the seat of awareness</strong>, you will start to <strong>feel this flow of energy coming up from deep within</strong></li>
<li>You don't have to get rid of loneliness; you just <strong>cease to be involved with it</strong>.
    Awareness does not fight; <strong>awareness releases</strong>. <strong>Awareness is simply aware while everything in the universe parades before it</strong></li>
<li><strong>It's ok to feel inner disturbances</strong>, and that they can no longer disturb your seat of consciousness, you will be free</li>

<p><strong>you don't feel whole and complete within yourself</strong> - <strong>fear</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>you will <strong>hide behind finances, people, fame, and adoration</strong></li>
<li>
<p>Just stop for a moment and <strong>see what you have given your mind to do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mind is constantly trying to give you advice about how to make it all okay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You mind is simply a computer<br />
    It can be used to ponder great thoughts, solve scientific problems, and serve humanity.
    But you are the one who is <strong>trying to use the analytical mind to protect yourself from the natural unfolding of life</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stop expecting the mind to protect yourself from the natural unfolding of life</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>U can live a life completely free from the fears of the psyche</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Just watch the mind talk</strong>, and <strong>keep relaxing and releasing</strong>. <strong>Fall behind the noise</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You</strong>, the one inside watching the neurotic mind, <strong>just relax</strong>; You are not the thinking mind; <strong>you are aware of the thinking mind</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The minute you <strong>stop putting your whole heart and soul into the mind</strong> as if it were your savior and protector, you will find yourself behing the mind watching it</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>begin this journey to freedom by <strong>regularly reminding yourself to watch the psyche</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>relax your shoulders</strong>, <strong>relax your heart</strong>, and <strong>stop putting energy into your psyche</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some triggers in everyday life that <strong>help U remember who you are</strong> and <strong>what's going on inside</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Every change in your energy flow</strong>, whether it's <strong>agitation of the mind</strong> or <strong>shifts in the heart</strong>,
    will be what <strong>eminds you that you are back there noticing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>remind you to remain centered. Eventually <strong>it will become quiet enough</strong> so that you can <strong>simply watch the heart begin to react</strong>, and <strong>let go before the mind starts</strong>. <strong>At some point in the journey it all becomes heart, not mind</strong>. You will <strong>see that the mind follows the heart</strong>. <strong>The heart reacts way before the mind starts talking</strong></li>
<li>When you are conscious, <strong>the shifts of energy in your heart cause you to instantaneously be aware that you are back there noticing</strong>. The mind doesn't even get a chance to start up because <strong>you let go at the heart level</strong></li>

<p>ch11 - pain, the price of freedom</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will come to see that any behavior pattern <strong>based on the avoidance of pain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>decide that you don't want to spend your entire life <strong>avoiding the inner pain</strong>; you'd rather get rid of it</li>
<li>you can <strong>simply live your life</strong> and <strong>experience what it's like to be on a planet</strong> that is spinning around in the middle of nowhere, until you die</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can <strong>feel the effects of 'close' as the sensation of contracting within your heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Somebody says sth displeasing, and <strong>you feel some disturbance in your heart</strong>. <strong>Then your mind starts talking</strong>: "I don't have to put up with this. I'll just walk away and never talk to them again. They'll be sorry." <strong>Your heart is attempting to pull back from what it's experiencing</strong> and protect itself so that it doesn't have to experience that feeling again</li>
<li>You do this because <strong>you cann't handle the pain you're feeling</strong>. As long as you can't handle the pain,you will react by closing in order to protect yourself. <strong>Once you close</strong>, <strong>your mind will build an entire psychological structure around your closed energy</strong>. <strong>Your thoughts will try to rationalize why you're right and what you should do about it</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you feel pain, <strong>simply view it as energy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At any moment you <strong>can feel frustration, anger, fear, jealousy, insecurity, or embarrassment</strong>.
    <strong>If you watch, you will see that the heart is trying to push it</strong> all away. If you want to be free,
    you have to <strong>learn to stop fighting these human feelings</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First <strong>accept that there is pain in your heart</strong>. Just <strong>accept that it is in there</strong> and <strong>that you are going to feel it</strong>. <strong>Accept that if you relax</strong>, <strong>it will have its moment before your awareness</strong>, and <strong>then it will pass</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pain is the price of freedom</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As you relax into the energy of the pain</strong>, <strong>you may feel tremendous heat in your heart</strong>. That is <strong>the pain being purified from your heart</strong>. <strong>Learn to enjoy that burning</strong> because it is freeing you.</li>
<li>And the moment you are willing to pay that price, you will no longer be afraid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are <strong>comfortable with pain passing through you</strong>, <strong>you will be free</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The worst the world can do is to hit the pain stored within you</strong>. <strong>If you do not care</strong>, <strong>if you are no longer afraid of yourself</strong>, <strong>you are free</strong>. <strong>You will then be able to walk through this world more vibrant and alive than ever before</strong>. <strong>You will feel everything at a deeper level</strong>.</li>

<p>You simply interact with the day <strong>with a peaceful, fully inspired heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your edges happen to get hit, <strong>the mind doesn't complain</strong>.
    It all just passes through. This is how great beings live.</li>

<p>ch14 - letting go of false solidity</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your sense of self is determined by <strong>where you are focusing your consciousness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are not your body; you <strong>look at you body in the mirror</strong> and <strong>experience this world through its eyes and ears</strong></li>
<li>you shift from concentrating on your body and its surroundings to concentrating on the world of the movie</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>you literally define yourself based on what you believe</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>we are all clinging and then building</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Just watch the fear</strong> <strong>without protecting yourself from it</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It was created by building a mental and emotional structure</strong> to get away from that sense of fear.</li>
<li>The events that happen in the moment <strong>belong to the moment</strong>. <strong>They have nothing to do with you</strong>.
    <strong>You must stop defining yourself in relationship to them</strong>, and just let them come and go.
    If you find yourself <strong>thinking about them later on</strong>, <strong>just let go</strong>. If an event happens that doesn't fit your conceptual model, and you see yourself struggling and rationalizing to make it fit, <strong>just notice what you're doing</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>learn to be comfortable with psychological disturbance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>why should anything that anyone says or does cause you to get disturbed?
    <strong>you're just on a planet</strong> spinning around the middle of absolutely nowhere.
    <strong>You came here to visit for a handful of years</strong> and <strong>then you're going to leave</strong>.
    <strong>How can U live all stressed-out over everything</strong>? Don't do it.
    <strong>If anything can cause disturbance inside of you</strong>, <strong>it means it hit your model</strong>.
    It means it hit the false part of you that you built in order to control your own definition of reality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must <strong>be willing to face this pain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Just see if you can <strong>relax behind it</strong>. and ask, "<strong>who am I that notices this</strong>?"</li>
<li>You can <strong>experience a life in which waves of love can rush up inside of you any time you want</strong>. you do that by letting go of the tendency to cling.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>ch15 - the path of unconditional happiness</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do U wanna be <strong>happy regardless of what happens</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of your life is <strong>to enjoy</strong> and <strong>learn from your experiences</strong>.
    <strong>You were not put on Earth to suffer</strong>. You're not helping anybody by being miserable.
    Regardless of your philosophical beliefs, the fact remains that <strong>you were born and you are going to die</strong>.
    Duiring the time in between, you <strong>get to choose whether or not you want to enjoy the experience</strong>.
    Events don't determine whether or not you're going to be happy. They're just events.
    <strong>You determine whether or not you're going to be happy</strong>.
    You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoying life's experiences</strong> is the only rational thing to do</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you wanna happy</strong>, you have to <strong>let go of the part of you that wants to create melodrama</strong></li>
<li>
<p>You're going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway.
    <strong>You gain nothing by being bothered by life's events</strong>. <strong>It doesn't change the world; you just suffer</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter what happens, <strong>just enjoy the life that comes to you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Committing yourself to unconditional happiness will <strong>teach you every single thing there</strong> is
    to <strong>learn about yourself</strong>, <strong>about others</strong>, and <strong>about the nature of life</strong>.
    <strong>You will learn all about your mind</strong>, <strong>your heart</strong>, and <strong>your will</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Begin by understanding your inner energies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you look inside, you will see that when you're happy,
    <strong>your heart feels open</strong> and <strong>the energy rushes up inside of you</strong></li>
<li>
<p>You should <strong>examing what it is inside of you that believes there's some benefit to closing</strong>.
    <strong>The slightest thing happens to you</strong>, and <strong>you give away your happiness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What good came from letting it ruin your day</strong>? <strong>There was no benefit</strong>.
    If somebody cuts you off, let go and stay open. If you really want to, you can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key is to <strong>learn to keep your mind disciplined enough</strong> so that it doesn't trick you into thinking that this time it's worth closing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Just pick yourself up</strong> and <strong>affirm inwardly that you don't wanna close</strong>, no matter what happens.
    <strong>Affirm that all you want is to be at peace and to appreciate life</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You mind will tell you that it's not reasonable to stay open when these things happen</strong>.
    But you have limited time left in your life, and <strong>what's really not reasonable is to not enjoy life</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meditation strengthens your center of consciousness</strong> so that you're always <strong>aware enough to not allow your heart to close</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you just relax your heart when it starts to tighten.
    <strong>you don't have to be outwardly glowing all the time</strong>; <strong>you're just joyful inside</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>close your eyes and breathe in and breathe out</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let thoughts and mental pictures pass by</strong>; <strong>Allow yourself to relax</strong></li>
<li>ask your heart, "<strong>What do U want to do right now</strong>?"<ul>
<li>Ideas from your heart can <strong>come through as words, images, feelings, or a joyful burst of action</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wait and listen for a response</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>bring your attention to your body</strong></li>
<li><strong>what does it feel like? Mad? Sad? Hurt?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Focus your awareness</strong> and keep breathing</li>
<li>Keep going until the cloud has floated away</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You're <strong>letting go of yourself so that you can remain happy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A person who actually does this every moment of every day is <strong>going to notice the cleansing of their heart</strong>.
    This is because <strong>they're not getting involved in the stuff that comes up</strong>.
    They're also going to <strong>notice the purification of their mind</strong> because they are <strong>not getting involved in the mind's melodrama</strong></li>
<li>You will let go no matter what, then the veils of the human mind and heart will fall away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch16 - the spiritual path of nonresistance</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>learn to <strong>live life without stress, problems, fear, or melodrama</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This path of <strong>using life to evolve spiritually</strong> is truly the highest path</li>
<li>Stress only happens when you resist life's events</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the willpower</strong> can stop the energy transfer, and that's what creates tension</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What we're really resisting is the experience of the event</strong> passing though us.
    <strong>We don't want it affecting us inside</strong>. We know <strong>it is going to make mental and emotional impressions that will not fit with what's already in there</strong>. So we assert the force of will against the influence
    of the event in an attempt to stop it from passing through our hearts and minds</li>
<li><strong>You are sitting inside resisting impressions from the past</strong> or <strong>thoughts about the future</strong>.
    <strong>You are actually struggling with yourself</strong>, <strong>not with the event</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use life to let go of these past impressions</strong> and <strong>the stress they create</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on these past impressions, you are <strong>resisting the current events</strong> that are taking place.
    This creates inner tension, turmoil, struggle, and suffering</li>
<li><strong>Carefully watch the mental voice that tells you to resist sth</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong> that events can make it through you without resistance</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You just deal with them as events that are taking place on the planet Earth</strong>, <strong>and not as personal problems</strong></li>
<li>They're just events. <strong>Your resistance to them is what causes the problem</strong></li>
<li>
<p><strong>If your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place</strong>.
    You would have no noise going on inside.
    Your capabilities would be exponential compared to what you've ever experienced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you're not trying to make people fit into your like or dislike</strong>,
    you will find that relationships are not really that difficult.
    If you're not so busy judging and resisting people based on what is blocked inside of you,
    you will find that they are much easier to get along with - and so are you.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>ch17 - contemplating death</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any time you're having trouble with sth, <strong>think of death</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the breath may not come back in, then I <strong>wanna live at the highest level while i'm alive</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since <strong>you know you're going to die</strong>, <strong>be willing to say what needs to be said</strong> and <strong>do what needs to be done</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using every day to <strong>let go of that scared part of you</strong> that won't let you live life fully<ul>
<li><strong>be willing to be fully present without being afraid of what will happen in the next moment</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If you live life fully</strong>, <strong>you won't have any last wishes</strong><ul>
<li>There is no reason to be afraid of life</li>
<li>the only thing there is to <strong>get from life is the growth</strong> that <strong>comes from experiencing it</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What is inside of us that is so afraid</strong> that it keeps us from just enjoying life?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>it is death that makes life precious</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every experience is worth having</strong>. Life is not sth to waste.</li>
<li><strong>take each moment of your life</strong> and <strong>realize that what matters is to live it fully</strong>.
    <strong>If you are living every experience fully, then death doesn't take anything from you</strong>.
    <strong>There's nothing to take because you're already fulfilled</strong>.</li>
<li>what you need is <strong>more depth of experience during the time you're given</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>live each moment of your life</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You let it touch you to the depths of your being</strong>.
    You let it fill you completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experiencing the life that's happening to you</p>
<ul>
<li>appreciate the moments you are given</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch18 - the secret of the middle way</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tao is in the middle</li>
<li>You <strong>don't follow the extremes</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch19 - the loving eyes of god</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You spirit drifts upward</p>
<ul>
<li>You feel that <strong>there's more of a distance between you and the thoughts and emotions</strong> inside of you. You drift back</li>
<li>
<p>You're <strong>no longer held down to your earthly self</strong>, so you begin to feel more spaciousness inside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don't seem to touch you as much because you've <strong>drifted behind the part of you</strong> that <strong>reacts to things</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How Your spiritual being feels?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>as you associate less with the physical and psychological parts of your being, you begin to identify more with the flow of pure energy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the body normally feels that it's generally <strong>uncomfortable</strong>;
    the psyche is generally full of <strong>complaints and fears</strong>;
    spirit always feels <strong>good, and high</strong>; it always feels <strong>open and light</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>you must release the personal self</strong>.
    <strong>As you release it, you drift back</strong>. As you go further back, you get higher.
    You get higher in vibration and higher in the amount of lvoe and lightness that you feel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As you let go and willingly release the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of your being</strong>,
    <strong>Spirit becomes your state</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Spirit you're experiencing</strong> is the doorway to God</p>
<ul>
<li>When they <strong>let go of the lower aspects of their being</strong>, they felt tremendous love, Spirit,
    and light waking up inside of them.
    They felt that nothing could come in through their senses <strong>that was higher than what was already going on inside</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let your being merge into GOD</p>
<ul>
<li>You drift into Spirit when you let go of your lower self</li>
<li>You are no longer judging. <strong>There is just appreciating and honoring</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>To see, to experience, and to honor is to participate in life</strong> instead of standing back and judging it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>True love doesn't judge</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Love sees nothing but beauty in its beloved</strong></li>
<li>If you've ever really loved anybody, then you know what true love means.
    It means that <strong>you love them more than you love yourself</strong>.
    If you truly love someone, <strong>your love sees past their humanness</strong>.
    <strong>It embraces their whole being</strong>, including past wrongs and current shortcomings.</li>
<li>It's like the unconditional love of a mother<ul>
<li>she thinks the child is beautiful.
    <strong>she doesn't focus on the shortcomings</strong>; she doesn't even see them as shortcomings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You have a loving God</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>being encouraged to <strong>feel completely protected, loved, honored, and respected by the Divine Force</strong></li>
<li>Your relationship with God is the same as <strong>your relationship with the sun</strong></li>
<li><strong>No matter what you do</strong>, <strong>and no matter what you've done</strong>, <strong>you will always be loved by GOD</strong></li>
</ul>
