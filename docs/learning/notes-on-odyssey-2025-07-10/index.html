<p>Soul vs Ego</p>
<ul>
<li>The ego lives in fear and the soul lives in love
    -</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch7</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are <strong>protecting your ego</strong>, <strong>your self-concept</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>close down the centers to <strong>avoid being too sensitive to the different energies coming in and causing fear</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you close and protect yourself</strong>, <strong>insecure person within your heart</strong>. <strong>You will never grow</strong></li>
<li>Living like this allows for very little spontaneous joy, enthusiasm, and excitement for life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No matter how much pain the exposure</strong> creates, you are <strong>willing to pay that price for freedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How often do U find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part</strong> of you?
    <strong>You start by watching life</strong> and <strong>noticing the constant flow of people and situations that hit your stuff</strong> every day</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reward for not protecting your psyche is <strong>liberation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are free to walk through this world without a problem on your mind</strong>.
    <strong>you are just having fun experiencing</strong> whatever happens next. <strong>Because you got rid of that scared part of you</strong>, you don't ever have to worry about getting hurt.</li>
<li><strong>You just go about your business</strong> and <strong>put your whole being into whatever's happening</strong>, instead of putting your whole being into your personal sensitivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your growth takes place</strong> onece you've <strong>made the commitment to free yourself of that scared person inside</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You notice a emotion or thought emerges</strong>, <strong>relax behind it</strong>. <strong>Don't judge it</strong>, <strong>don't try to change it</strong>.</li>
<li>if you <strong>use your inner willpower to not go with it</strong>, and just remain seated within.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>you decide to use life to free yourself</strong>. <strong>You become willing to pay any price for the freedom of your soul</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A wise person remains centered enough to <strong>let go every time the energy shifts into a defensive mode</strong>. The moment the energy moves and <strong>you feel your consciousness start to get drawn into it</strong>, you <strong>relax and release</strong>. <strong>Falling behind the energy</strong> instead of going into it. It just takes a moment of <strong>conscious effort to decide that you're not going there</strong>. You just let go.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter what others do, <strong>unless you decide that it matters to you</strong>.
    Only you can take inner freedom away from yourself or give it to yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn to let go no matter how deep the pain</strong>, you will achieve a great state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch6</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are the <strong>experiencer of your spiritual heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You feel the heart's energy all the time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>what it is like to feel love in your heart</li>
<li>what it is like to feel inspiration and enthusiasm pour from your heart</li>
<li>what it is like to feel energy well up in your heart making you confident and strong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All of the different things happen because the heart goes through changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we <strong>fall in love if the heart</strong> opens; the love stops if the heart closes</li>
<li>if the heart happens to <strong>hurt, we get angry</strong></li>
<li>if we stop <strong>feeling it altogether, we get empty</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All the inner noise is just your attempt to process the blocked energy</strong> and get it out of the way</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>truly amazing to step back and look at this process</strong><ul>
<li>As you willfully struggle to keep these events from passing through your consciousness,
    <strong>the energy first tries to release by manifesting through the mind</strong>. it <strong>then tries to release through the heart</strong>. <strong>That is what creates all the emotional activity</strong>.
    <strong>When you resist even that release</strong>, the energy gets packed up and forced into deep storage within the heart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you are <strong>wasting precious energy by blocking the flow through resisting and clinging</strong><ul>
<li><strong>those that cause either problems or some sense of enjoyment</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoy life instead of clinging to it or pushing it away</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you can live like this, each moment will change you</strong>.
    If you are <strong>willing to experience the gift of life</strong> instead of fighting with it,
    you will <strong>be moved to the depth of your being</strong>.</li>
<li>when you reach this state, you will begin to see the secrets of the heart.<ul>
<li><strong>The heart is the place through which energy flows to sustain you</strong>. This energy inspires you and raises you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Just open</strong>, <strong>relax your heart</strong>, <strong>forgive</strong>, <strong>smile</strong>, or <strong>do anything you want</strong><ul>
<li>Just don't push it back down</li>
<li><strong>be willing to let it go</strong> when it gets stimulated. <strong>It only hurts for a minute and then it's over</strong><ul>
<li>when that light blue Mustang drives by and <strong>you feel fear or jealousy</strong>, <strong>just smile</strong>.
    <strong>Be happy that</strong> this Samskara, which has been stored down there for all this time, <strong>has the opportunity to make it through you</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simply allow the experiences of life to come in and pass through your being</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be centered enough to just watch this stuff come up</strong>. <strong>Just let it all happen</strong>. Don't process them.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stop fighting it</strong>, they'll come up constantl yand pass right through you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your reward is a permanently open heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You live in love</strong>, and <strong>it feeds you and strengthens you</strong>;
    <strong>Allow yourself to experience every note the heart can play</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch5</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you don't feel <strong>this energy when you close your heart or close your mind</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spiritual energy</strong> - Spirit - is what you're experiencing when love rushes up into your heart</p>
<ul>
<li>this flow of energy comes from the depth of your being</li>
<li>we are programmed based on our past impressions such that all kinds of things can cause us to open and close</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace life with all your heart and soul</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No matter what it is</strong>, it's beautiful when you feel that way inside<ul>
<li><strong>Train yourself to open</strong> every time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Honor and respect the situation</strong>. <strong>Deal with it with openness</strong><ul>
<li>"No. I'm not going to close. <strong>I'm going to relax</strong>. <strong>I'm going to let this situation take place</strong> and <strong>be there with it</strong>."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoy all of life</strong>. <strong>Dare to be different</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As long as you are defining what you like and what you don't like, you will open and close.
    You are actually defining your limits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You become a source of light</strong> for all those around you</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>people can pick up on your energy</strong>, and you're feeding them with this flow</li>
<li>if you love life, nothing is worth closing over</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch4</p>
<ul>
<li>meditation<ul>
<li>you must not only have the ability to <strong>focus your consciousness completely on one object</strong>,
    you must also have the ability to make awareness itself be that object</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You just <strong>happen to be watching one</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The world is just something you're watching</strong>
    <strong>The more you are willing to just let the world be sth you're aware of</strong>,
    <strong>the more it will let you be who you are - the Soul, the Self</strong></li>
<li><strong>Instead of just focusing on intently on this one human being's thoughts, emotions, and sensory world</strong>, <strong>you can pull back and see everything</strong>. <strong>You can move from the finite to the infinite</strong>.
    this is what Christ, buddha try to tell us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch1</p>
<ul>
<li>To be aware that <strong>you are watching</strong> the mind talks<ul>
<li>You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense making you feel more secure.
    As long as that's what you want, you will be forced to <strong>constantly use your mind to buffer yourself</strong> from life, instead of living it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Come to know the one</strong> who watches the voice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch2</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There's a <strong>separation between you and the anger of the jealousy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The first is you</strong>, <strong>the awareness</strong>, <strong>the witness</strong>, <strong>the center of your willful intentions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The other is that which you watch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just be aware of it</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sit inside yourself for a while</strong> in complete solitude and silence</li>
<li>you're so close that you don't realize that <strong>you're actually hypnotized into listening to the voice</strong></li>
<li><strong>if you could get rid of the voice</strong>, the peace and serenity would be the nicest vacation you're ever had</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>you'll never be free of problems until <strong>you are free from the part within</strong> that has so many problems</p>
<ul>
<li>"<strong>What part of me is being disturbed</strong> by this?";
    "What part of me is jealous?"</li>
<li>
<p>"<strong>who notices this inner</strong> disturbance?"</p>
<ul>
<li>To attain true inner freedom, you must be able to <strong>objectively watch your problems</strong> instead of being lost in them</li>
<li>No solution can possibly exist while you're lost in the energy of a problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>go inside and <strong>let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you do that, you'll be clear enough to deal with what's left</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit yourself to the inner work of freedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche.
    You have to take it back</li>
<li><strong>distance yourself from your voice, psyche</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This is Your life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stand firm in the seat of the witness</strong> and <strong>release the hold</strong> that the habitual mind has on you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your will is stronger than the habit</strong> of listening to that voice.
    <strong>There is nothing you can't do</strong>. <strong>Your will is supreme</strong> over all of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yoga</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch3</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who are You</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I am the one who sees</strong>.
    I look out, and I am aware of the events, thoughts, and emotions that pass before me</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When you just look without creating thoughts</strong>, your consciousness is effortlessly aware of, and fully comprehends, all that it sees</p>
<ul>
<li>the is your soul/self - <strong>awareness, consciousness, and intuitive sense of existence</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You are behind everything</strong>, Just watching</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>sit far enough back inside to see</strong> all <strong>your thoughts and emotions</strong> , as well as outer form</li>
<li><strong>All of these objects are in front of you</strong> . The thoughts are closer in, the emotions are a little further away, and form is way out there. Behind it all, there you are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <strong>live in the seat of consciousness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the seat, you are aware that there are <strong>thoughts, emotions, and a world coming in</strong> through your senses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
