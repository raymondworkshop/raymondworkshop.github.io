<ul>
<li>To be aware that <strong>you are watching</strong> the mind talks<ul>
<li>You use it as a protection mechanism, a form of defense making you feel more secure.
    As long as that's what you want, you will be forced to <strong>constantly use your mind to buffer yourself</strong> from life, instead of living it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Come to know the one</strong> who watches the voice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch2</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you'll never be free of problems until <strong>you are free from the part within</strong> that has so many problems</p>
<ul>
<li>"<strong>What part of me is being disturbed</strong> by this?";
    "What part of me is jealous?"</li>
<li>
<p>"<strong>who notices this inner</strong> disturbance?"</p>
<ul>
<li>To attain true inner freedom, you must be able to <strong>objectively watch your problems</strong> instead of being lost in them.</li>
<li>No solution can possibly exist while you're lost in the energy of a problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>go inside and <strong>let go of the part of you that seems to have so many problems with reality</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you do that, you'll be clear enough to deal with what's left.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit yourself to the inner work of freedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>your life is not your own; it belongs to your inner roommate, the psyche.
    You have to take it back</li>
<li><strong>distance yourself from your voice, psyche</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This is Your life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stand firm in the seat of the witness</strong> and <strong>release the hold</strong> that the habitual mind has on you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your will is stronger than the habit</strong> of listening to that voice.
    <strong>There is nothing you can't do</strong>. <strong>Your will is supreme</strong> over all of this.</p>

<p>Who are You</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I am the one who sees</strong>.
    I look out, and I am aware of the events, thoughts, and emotions that pass before me</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You are behind everything</strong>, Just watching</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>sit far enough back inside to see</strong> all <strong>your thoughts and emotions</strong> , as well as outer form</li>
<li><strong>All of these objects are in front of you</strong> . The thoughts are closer in, the emotions are a little further away, and form is way out there. Behind it all, there you are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You <strong>live in the seat of consciousness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the seat, you are aware that there are <strong>thoughts, emotions, and a world coming in</strong> through your senses</li>
