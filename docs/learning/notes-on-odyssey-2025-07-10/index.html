<p>Ego always has and always will be the greatest obstacle to love.
    Because love is about sacrificing the self for the other,
    whilst ego is about sacrificing the other for the self. This is why mutual self sacrifice is the winning formula. No asymmetry, just reciprocity.</p>

<li>
<p>ch16 - the spiritual path of nonresistance</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>learn to <strong>live life without stress, problems, fear, or melodrama</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This path of <strong>using life to evolve spiritually</strong> is truly the highest path</li>
<li>Stress only happens when you resist life's events</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the willpower</strong> can stop the energy transfer, and that's what creates tension</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What we're really resisting is the experience of the event</strong> passing though us.
    <strong>We don't want it affecting us inside</strong>. We know <strong>it is going to make mental and emotional impressions that will not fit with what's already in there</strong>. So we assert the force of will against the influence
    of the event in an attempt to stop it from passing through our hearts and minds</li>
<li><strong>You are sitting inside resisting impressions from the past</strong> or <strong>thoughts about the future</strong>.
    <strong>You are actually struggling with yourself</strong>, <strong>not with the event</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use life to let go of these past impressions</strong> and <strong>the stress they create</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on these past impressions, you are <strong>resisting the current events</strong> that are taking place.
    This creates inner tension, turmoil, struggle, and suffering</li>
<li><strong>Carefully watch the mental voice that tells you to resist sth</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong> that events can make it through you without resistance</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You just deal with them as events that are taking place on the planet Earth</strong>, <strong>and not as personal problems</strong></li>
<li>They're just events. <strong>Your resistance to them is what causes the problem</strong></li>
<li>
<p><strong>If your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place</strong>.
    You would have no noise going on inside.
    Your capabilities would be exponential compared to what you've ever experienced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you're not trying to make people fit into your like or dislike</strong>,
    you will find that relationships are not really that difficult.
    If you're not so busy judging and resisting people based on what is blocked inside of you,
    you will find that they are much easier to get along with - and so are you.</p>

<p>ch15 - the path of unconditional happiness</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do U wanna be <strong>happy regardless of what happens</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of your life is <strong>to enjoy</strong> and <strong>learn from your experiences</strong>.
    <strong>You were not put on Earth to suffer</strong>. You're not helping anybody by being miserable.
    Regardless of your philosophical beliefs, the fact remains that <strong>you were born and you are going to die</strong>.
    Duiring the time in between, you <strong>get to choose whether or not you want to enjoy the experience</strong>.
    Events don't determine whether or not you're going to be happy. They're just events.
    <strong>You determine whether or not you're going to be happy</strong>.
    You can be happy just to be alive. You can be happy having all these things happen to you, and then be happy to die.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoying life's experiences</strong> is the only rational thing to do</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you wanna happy</strong>, you have to <strong>let go of the part of you that wants to create melodrama</strong></li>
<li>
<p>You're going to die anyway. Things are going to happen anyway.
    <strong>You gain nothing by being bothered by life's events</strong>. <strong>It doesn't change the world; you just suffer</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter what happens, <strong>just enjoy the life that comes to you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Committing yourself to unconditional happiness will <strong>teach you every single thing there</strong> is
    to <strong>learn about yourself</strong>, <strong>about others</strong>, and <strong>about the nature of life</strong>.
    <strong>You will learn all about your mind</strong>, <strong>your heart</strong>, and <strong>your will</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Begin by understanding your inner energies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you look inside, you will see that when you're happy,
    <strong>your heart feels open</strong> and <strong>the energy rushes up inside of you</strong></li>
<li>
<p>You should <strong>examing what it is inside of you that believes there's some benefit to closing</strong>.
    <strong>The slightest thing happens to you</strong>, and <strong>you give away your happiness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What good came from letting it ruin your day</strong>? <strong>There was no benefit</strong>.
    If somebody cuts you off, let go and stay open. If you really want to, you can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key is to <strong>learn to keep your mind disciplined enough</strong> so that it doesn't trick you into thinking that this time it's worth closing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Just pick yourself up</strong> and <strong>affirm inwardly that you don't wanna close</strong>, no matter what happens.
    <strong>Affirm that all you want is to be at peace and to appreciate life</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You mind will tell you that it's not reasonable to stay open when these things happen</strong>.
    But you have limited time left in your life, and <strong>what's really not reasonable is to not enjoy life</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meditation strengthens your center of consciousness</strong> so that you're always <strong>aware enough to not allow your heart to close</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you just relax your heart when it starts to tighten.
    <strong>you don't have to be outwardly glowing all the time</strong>; <strong>you're just joyful inside</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>close your eyes and breathe in and breathe out</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let thoughts and mental pictures pass by</strong>; <strong>Allow yourself to relax</strong></li>
<li>ask your heart, "<strong>What do U want to do right now</strong>?"<ul>
<li>Ideas from your heart can <strong>come through as words, images, feelings, or a joyful burst of action</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wait and listen for a response</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>bring your attention to your body</strong></li>
<li><strong>what does it feel like? Mad? Sad? Hurt?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Focus your awareness</strong> and keep breathing</li>
<li>Keep going until the cloud has floated away</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You're <strong>letting go of yourself so that you can remain happy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A person who actually does this every moment of every day is <strong>going to notice the cleansing of their heart</strong>.
    This is because <strong>they're not getting involved in the stuff that comes up</strong>.
    They're also going to <strong>notice the purification of their mind</strong> because they are <strong>not getting involved in the mind's melodrama</strong></li>
<li>You will let go no matter what, then the veils of the human mind and heart will fall away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ch14 - letting go of false solidity</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your sense of self is determined by <strong>where you are focusing your consciousness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are not your body; you <strong>look at you body in the mirror</strong> and <strong>experience this world through its eyes and ears</strong></li>
<li>you shift from concentrating on your body and its surroundings to concentrating on the world of the movie</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>you literally define yourself based on what you believe</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>we are all clinging and then building</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Just watch the fear</strong> <strong>without protecting yourself from it</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It was created by building a mental and emotional structure</strong> to get away from that sense of fear.</li>
<li>The events that happen in the moment <strong>belong to the moment</strong>. <strong>They have nothing to do with you</strong>.
    <strong>You must stop defining yourself in relationship to them</strong>, and just let them come and go.
    If you find yourself <strong>thinking about them later on</strong>, <strong>just let go</strong>. If an event happens that doesn't fit your conceptual model, and you see yourself struggling and rationalizing to make it fit, <strong>just notice what you're doing</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>learn to be comfortable with psychological disturbance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>why should anything that anyone says or does cause you to get disturbed?
    <strong>you're just on a planet</strong> spinning around the middle of absolutely nowhere.
    <strong>You came here to visit for a handful of years</strong> and <strong>then you're going to leave</strong>.
    <strong>How can U live all stressed-out over everything</strong>? Don't do it.
    <strong>If anything can cause disturbance inside of you</strong>, <strong>it means it hit your model</strong>.
    It means it hit the false part of you that you built in order to control your own definition of reality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must <strong>be willing to face this pain</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Just see if you can <strong>relax behind it</strong>. and ask, "<strong>who am I that notices this</strong>?"</li>
<li>You can <strong>experience a life in which waves of love can rush up inside of you any time you want</strong>. you do that by letting go of the tendency to cling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hear and MIND balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mind is great at learning and solving problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heart talks to US through joy &amp; LOVE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heart loves YOU exactly the way you are</strong>.
    <strong>It doesn't matter if</strong> you trip and fall on your shoelaces or burn the banana bread.</li>
<li>Heart is great at being in the HERE and NOW</li>
<li><strong>Heart can tell Mind that it will love without any judgment</strong><ul>
<li><strong>If heart feels the spark to dance</strong>, but Mind thinks that it will look silly since it is not a REAL dancer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind will hold Heart's hand and take one step in any direction until <strong>they know what Heart wants</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy where you are right now. Because right now is your greatest gift. That's why we call it The present</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice <strong>listening to your heart</strong> and <strong>use your mind to take action</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>close your eyes, and <strong>take some deep breaths</strong></li>
<li><strong>Let thoughts and mental pictures pass by</strong>; <strong>Allow yourself to relax</strong></li>
<li>ask your heart, "<strong>What do U want to do right now</strong>?"<ul>
<li>Ideas from your heart can <strong>come through as words, images, feelings, or a joyful burst of action</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wait and listen for a response</strong></li>
<li>Use your mind to take action</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Awareness is a tool we use to understand Mind and Heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's like <strong>a light that helps us see what is real</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breathing helps Mind to stop worrying</strong> about yesterday or tomorrow and instead, be in the HERE and NOW</p>

<p>ch13 - far, far beyond</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>go beyond your model</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There's a reason</strong> for everything you do<ul>
<li>They are the outermost layer of cause. If you can sit through these urges,
    <strong>you will see what caused them</strong>. If you can get comfortable with what you see, you will face the next layer of causation, and so on, <strong>layer upon layer</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>See what happens to the energies inside of you when you don't do the things</strong> that make you comfortable<ul>
<li>what you'll see is why you're doing them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if the moment is outside your expectations, <strong>your mind starts talking</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>free yourself from the limits of your model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you don't stay within them, you get scared</strong>, you feel hurt, and you feel threatened.
    That's your cage</li>
<li>It can be a cage created by your fear of discomfort.
    <strong>If you approach your limits, you begin to feel uncomfortable and insecure</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is free to experience all of life</p>
<ul>
<li>This can only happen <strong>when you are willing to face reality without mental boundaries</strong></li>
<li>When you approach the edges <strong>you feel insecurity, jealousy, fear, or self-consciousness</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You simply interact with the day <strong>with a peaceful, fully inspired heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your edges happen to get hit, <strong>the mind doesn't complain</strong>.
    It all just passes through. This is how great beings live.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>you must go past these walls</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>activate these old feelings of fear</strong>, and you decide to walk right toward it</li>
<li>It <strong>shakes you to the core of your being</strong> because it challenges the house of thougths in which you are dwelling. To fix this, you start in with your rationalizations</li>

<p>You can <strong>feel the effects of 'close' as the sensation of contracting within your heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Somebody says sth displeasing, and <strong>you feel some disturbance in your heart</strong>. <strong>Then your mind starts talking</strong>: "I don't have to put up with this. I'll just walk away and never talk to them again. They'll be sorry." <strong>Your heart is attempting to pull back from what it's experiencing</strong> and protect itself so that it doesn't have to experience that feeling again</li>
<li>You do this because <strong>you cann't handle the pain you're feeling</strong>. As long as you can't handle the pain,you will react by closing in order to protect yourself. <strong>Once you close</strong>, <strong>your mind will build an entire psychological structure around your closed energy</strong>. <strong>Your thoughts will try to rationalize why you're right and what you should do about it</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you feel pain, <strong>simply view it as energy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At any moment you <strong>can feel frustration, anger, fear, jealousy, insecurity, or embarrassment</strong>.
    <strong>If you watch, you will see that the heart is trying to push it</strong> all away. If you want to be free,
    you have to <strong>learn to stop fighting these human feelings</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First <strong>accept that there is pain in your heart</strong>. Just <strong>accept that it is in there</strong> and <strong>that you are going to feel it</strong>. <strong>Accept that if you relax</strong>, <strong>it will have its moment before your awareness</strong>, and <strong>then it will pass</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pain is the price of freedom</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As you relax into the energy of the pain</strong>, <strong>you may feel tremendous heat in your heart</strong>. That is <strong>the pain being purified from your heart</strong>. <strong>Learn to enjoy that burning</strong> because it is freeing you.</li>
<li>And the moment you are willing to pay that price, you will no longer be afraid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are <strong>comfortable with pain passing through you</strong>, <strong>you will be free</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The worst the world can do is to hit the pain stored within you</strong>. <strong>If you do not care</strong>, <strong>if you are no longer afraid of yourself</strong>, <strong>you are free</strong>. <strong>You will then be able to walk through this world more vibrant and alive than ever before</strong>. <strong>You will feel everything at a deeper level</strong>.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>you don't feel whole and complete within yourself</strong> - <strong>fear</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>you will <strong>hide behind finances, people, fame, and adoration</strong></li>
<li>
<p>Just stop for a moment and <strong>see what you have given your mind to do</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mind is constantly trying to give you advice about how to make it all okay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You mind is simply a computer<br />
    It can be used to ponder great thoughts, solve scientific problems, and serve humanity.
    But you are the one who is <strong>trying to use the analytical mind to protect yourself from the natural unfolding of life</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stop expecting the mind to protect yourself from the natural unfolding of life</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>U can live a life completely free from the fears of the psyche</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Just watch the mind talk</strong>, and <strong>keep relaxing and releasing</strong>. <strong>Fall behind the noise</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You</strong>, the one inside watching the neurotic mind, <strong>just relax</strong>; You are not the thinking mind; <strong>you are aware of the thinking mind</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The minute you <strong>stop putting your whole heart and soul into the mind</strong> as if it were your savior and protector, you will find yourself behing the mind watching it</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>begin this journey to freedom by <strong>regularly reminding yourself to watch the psyche</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>relax your shoulders</strong>, <strong>relax your heart</strong>, and <strong>stop putting energy into your psyche</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some triggers in everyday life that <strong>help U remember who you are</strong> and <strong>what's going on inside</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Every change in your energy flow</strong>, whether it's <strong>agitation of the mind</strong> or <strong>shifts in the heart</strong>,
    will be what <strong>eminds you that you are back there noticing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>remind you to remain centered. Eventually <strong>it will become quiet enough</strong> so that you can <strong>simply watch the heart begin to react</strong>, and <strong>let go before the mind starts</strong>. <strong>At some point in the journey it all becomes heart, not mind</strong>. You will <strong>see that the mind follows the heart</strong>. <strong>The heart reacts way before the mind starts talking</strong></li>
<li>When you are conscious, <strong>the shifts of energy in your heart cause you to instantaneously be aware that you are back there noticing</strong>. The mind doesn't even get a chance to start up because <strong>you let go at the heart level</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Being or thinking</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you're feeling sth, <strong>bring in your awareness to check out where the feeling is coming from</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Being -&gt; Feeling -&gt; Intuitive Sparks -&gt; Inspired Action</strong> - Heart</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathe in and breathe out</strong>; <strong>Close your eyes and clear you mind</strong>.
    You'll <strong>start to sense an energy within you and around you</strong>.
    <strong>It feels elevating, expansive, and really nice</strong>.
    This sensation is not there due to a thought in the mind.
    <strong>When you have cleared your awareness from the mind</strong>, <strong>you are simply being</strong>.
    And <strong>in this simplicity of being</strong>, you <strong>find a deep sense of peace</strong>.
    And in this deep sense of peace, you will start to <strong>sense greater sensations of joy, love, and freedom</strong>. And <strong>here lies the heart</strong>. Where, <strong>regardless of the 'situation' you're in now, you still feel great</strong>. But, the feeling didn't come from a thought. The feeling came from being.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking -&gt; Feeling - Mind</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The feeling is a direct result of the mind thinking</strong>.
    And the feeling from the thoughts continue to lead to more thoughts that match the level of the feeling.</li>

<p><strong>Do not doubt your ability to remove the root cause of the disturbance inside of you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Donot <strong>Let the fear of their inner thorns</strong> affect the behavior</li>
<li>You can <strong>look deep within yourself</strong>, <strong>to the core of your being</strong>,
    and <strong>decide that you don't want the weakest part of you running your life</strong><ul>
<li>You wanna talk to people because you find them interesting, not because you're lonely</li>
<li>you wanna have relationships with people because you genuinely like them, not because you need for them to like you</li>
<li>you wanna love because you truly love, not because you need to avoid your inner problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>you <strong>free yourself by finding yourself</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stop playing with them</strong>.
    If you want, you can simply <strong>permit the disturbances to come up</strong>, and you can <strong>let them go</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What you can do is <strong>notice that you notices</strong>.
    You <strong>notice it is watching your inner melodrama</strong>.
    <strong>Notice who it is that feels</strong> the loneliness. The one who notices is already free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you maintain your center, you can <strong>learn to appreciate and respect even the difficult experiences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>See it feel jealousy, need, and fear</strong>; They are <strong>just sth you're feeling and experiencing</strong>.
    You are the indwelling being that is aware of all of this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be an explorer</strong>. <strong>Witness it</strong>, and <strong>then it will go</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notice and just watch how experiencing loneliness affects you</strong>.
    Does your <strong>posture</strong> change? Do you <strong>breathe</strong> slower or faster?
    <strong>What goes on</strong> when loneliness is given the space it needs to pass through you?</li>
<li>If you don't get absorbed in it, <strong>the experience will soon pass</strong> and <strong>sth else will come up</strong>.
    <strong>Just enjoy all of it</strong>. If you can do this, you will be free, and <strong>a world of pure energy will open up within you</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experience if you hang out with the SELF</strong> instead of hanging out with inner disturbances</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sit comfortably deep inside the seat of awareness</strong>, you will start to <strong>feel this flow of energy coming up from deep within</strong></li>
<li>You don't have to get rid of loneliness; you just <strong>cease to be involved with it</strong>.
    Awareness does not fight; <strong>awareness releases</strong>. <strong>Awareness is simply aware while everything in the universe parades before it</strong></li>
<li><strong>It's ok to feel inner disturbances</strong>, and that they can no longer disturb your seat of consciousness, you will be free</li>

<p><strong>Fear</strong> is the cause of every problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of spiritual evolution is to <strong>remove the blockages that cause your fear</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You simply perit the pain to come up into your heart and pass through</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to <strong>be free to the core of your being</strong>, you must <strong>let go immediately</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>you <strong>notice that sth in your heart gets hit</strong><br />
<strong>If you let go</strong> and stay in the seat of awareness, what you are noticing will pass</li>
<li>You <strong>could have taken one breath</strong> and ** let go when it started**</li>
<li>or <strong>as your consciousness gets immersed in the disturbance</strong>, you lose your clear seat of Self</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open your heart</strong>, and <strong>let it go as you're aware that you didn't</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not rationalize, blame, or try to figure it out.
    <strong>Don't do anything, Just let go immediately</strong>, and <strong>allow the energy to go back to the highest center of consciousness</strong> it can achieve.</li>
<li><strong>If you feel shame, let it go</strong>. <strong>If you feel fear</strong>, <strong>let it go</strong>.</li>

<p>Soul vs Ego</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The ego lives in fear</strong> and <strong>the soul lives in love</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the ego is a person's sense of <strong>self-importance</strong>; it is your social mask;
    <strong>your social mask thrives on approval</strong>. It wants control, and it is sustained <strong>by power</strong>, because it lives in fear.</li>
<li>our ego was 'created' to keep us safe. It is <strong>a shield that protects our true emotions</strong>
    we need to do this because of a lack of <strong>trust</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>how is <strong>big ego different from confidence</strong>, and loving ourselves?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>whether our soul is present or not</strong></li>
<li>when someone's ego is too big, we categorise them as being selfish and solely focused on themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>impossible for both the ego and the soul to be working at the same time</p>
<ul>
<li>each and everything we do feeds one of them</li>
<li>it is up to us to <strong>recognize which one is present and when</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>in each decision you make, ask yourself <strong>is this my ego or my soul talking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>这个决定是<strong>被爱，激情或其他正能量的东西驱动</strong>，还是被恐惧所驱动</li>
<li>when we can recognize the difference - fear or love - and <strong>step outside of our ego</strong>, we can <strong>welcome the soul in</strong></li>
<li>people who seek revenge, or do sth simply for spite, are overcome by their ego</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>spiritual and personal development is often to <strong>quiet the ego</strong> and <strong>cultivate a stronger connection with the soul</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>this involves <strong>recognizing the ego's patterns</strong>, <strong>understanding its motivations</strong>,
    and <strong>learning to discern its voice from the soul's gentle guidance</strong></li>
<li>some people find that <strong>breathwork</strong>, <strong>meditation</strong>, or <strong>prayer</strong> helps them to <strong>center themselves and clear their minds</strong> so they can <strong>hear the soft whisperings of their souls</strong>. others find <strong>journaling or spending time in nature</strong> helps tham to connect with their inner guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soul</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a deeper, true self</strong></li>
<li>connected to <strong>love, peace, and compassion</strong></li>
<li>guide us <strong>towards authenticity, purpose, and inner fulfilment</strong></li>
<li>through <strong>intuition</strong>, <strong>gut feelings</strong>, and gentle nudges</li>
<li><strong>on being present</strong>, <strong>accepting</strong>, and <strong>finding joy</strong> in the journey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ego</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>self-identity</strong>, built on a collection of <strong>beliefs</strong>, <strong>experiences</strong>, and <strong>self-perceptions</strong></li>
<li><strong>driven by fear</strong>, insecurity, and a desire for external validation</li>
<li>seek to <strong>protect itself</strong>, maintain control, and achieve a sense of worth through external means</li>
<li>through <strong>self-doubt</strong>, <strong>negative self-talk</strong>, and a focus on what's lacking</li>
<li>on the past, the future, and <strong>accumulating external achievements</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>ch7</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are <strong>protecting your ego</strong>, <strong>your self-concept</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>close down the centers to <strong>avoid being too sensitive to the different energies coming in and causing fear</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you close and protect yourself</strong>, <strong>insecure person within your heart</strong>. <strong>You will never grow</strong></li>
<li>Living like this allows for very little spontaneous joy, enthusiasm, and excitement for life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No matter how much pain the exposure</strong> creates, you are <strong>willing to pay that price for freedom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How often do U find yourself trying to protect and defend that weak part</strong> of you?
    <strong>You start by watching life</strong> and <strong>noticing the constant flow of people and situations that hit your stuff</strong> every day</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reward for not protecting your psyche is <strong>liberation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are free to walk through this world without a problem on your mind</strong>.
    <strong>you are just having fun experiencing</strong> whatever happens next. <strong>Because you got rid of that scared part of you</strong>, you don't ever have to worry about getting hurt.</li>
<li><strong>You just go about your business</strong> and <strong>put your whole being into whatever's happening</strong>, instead of putting your whole being into your personal sensitivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your growth takes place</strong> onece you've <strong>made the commitment to free yourself of that scared person inside</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You notice a emotion or thought emerges</strong>, <strong>relax behind it</strong>. <strong>Don't judge it</strong>, <strong>don't try to change it</strong>.</li>
<li>if you <strong>use your inner willpower to not go with it</strong>, and just remain seated within.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>you decide to use life to free yourself</strong>. <strong>You become willing to pay any price for the freedom of your soul</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A wise person remains centered enough to <strong>let go every time the energy shifts into a defensive mode</strong>. The moment the energy moves and <strong>you feel your consciousness start to get drawn into it</strong>, you <strong>relax and release</strong>. <strong>Falling behind the energy</strong> instead of going into it. It just takes a moment of <strong>conscious effort to decide that you're not going there</strong>. You just let go.</li>
<li>It doesn't matter what others do, <strong>unless you decide that it matters to you</strong>.
    Only you can take inner freedom away from yourself or give it to yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn to let go no matter how deep the pain</strong>, you will achieve a great state.</p>

<p>You are the <strong>experiencer of your spiritual heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You feel the heart's energy all the time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>what it is like to feel love in your heart</li>
<li>what it is like to feel inspiration and enthusiasm pour from your heart</li>
<li>what it is like to feel energy well up in your heart making you confident and strong</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All of the different things happen because the heart goes through changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we <strong>fall in love if the heart</strong> opens; the love stops if the heart closes</li>
<li>if the heart happens to <strong>hurt, we get angry</strong></li>
<li>if we stop <strong>feeling it altogether, we get empty</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All the inner noise is just your attempt to process the blocked energy</strong> and get it out of the way</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>truly amazing to step back and look at this process</strong><ul>
<li>As you willfully struggle to keep these events from passing through your consciousness,
    <strong>the energy first tries to release by manifesting through the mind</strong>. it <strong>then tries to release through the heart</strong>. <strong>That is what creates all the emotional activity</strong>.
    <strong>When you resist even that release</strong>, the energy gets packed up and forced into deep storage within the heart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you are <strong>wasting precious energy by blocking the flow through resisting and clinging</strong><ul>
<li><strong>those that cause either problems or some sense of enjoyment</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoy life instead of clinging to it or pushing it away</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you can live like this, each moment will change you</strong>.
    If you are <strong>willing to experience the gift of life</strong> instead of fighting with it,
    you will <strong>be moved to the depth of your being</strong>.</li>
<li>when you reach this state, you will begin to see the secrets of the heart.<ul>
<li><strong>The heart is the place through which energy flows to sustain you</strong>. This energy inspires you and raises you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Just open</strong>, <strong>relax your heart</strong>, <strong>forgive</strong>, <strong>smile</strong>, or <strong>do anything you want</strong><ul>
<li>Just don't push it back down</li>
<li><strong>be willing to let it go</strong> when it gets stimulated. <strong>It only hurts for a minute and then it's over</strong><ul>
<li>when that light blue Mustang drives by and <strong>you feel fear or jealousy</strong>, <strong>just smile</strong>.
    <strong>Be happy that</strong> this Samskara, which has been stored down there for all this time, <strong>has the opportunity to make it through you</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simply allow the experiences of life to come in and pass through your being</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be centered enough to just watch this stuff come up</strong>. <strong>Just let it all happen</strong>. Don't process them.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stop fighting it</strong>, they'll come up constantl yand pass right through you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your reward is a permanently open heart</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You live in love</strong>, and <strong>it feeds you and strengthens you</strong>;
    <strong>Allow yourself to experience every note the heart can play</strong>.</li>
