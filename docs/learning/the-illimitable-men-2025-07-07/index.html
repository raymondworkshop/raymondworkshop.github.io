<p><strong>People who create</strong> are more interesting than people who don't

<li>losers have a scarcity mindset</li>
<li>losers are a needy personality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>work for youself</strong> as soon as you can</p>
<ul>
<li>because they're <strong>not Machiavellian enough</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winners <strong>need a goal higher than themselves</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality beats quantity</p>

<h4>negotiation</h4>
<ul>
<li>perceptions in negotiation - friend or foe?<ul>
<li>In the presence of <strong>hatred or a need for revenge</strong>,
    otherwise logical and desirable outcomes are rejected in favor of schadenfrede.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the narcissism of negotiation</p>
<ul>
<li>high self-esteem + shit-test<ul>
<li>they're worth more than they really are because they're good at making weak people agree to bad deals</li>
<li>a successful businessman is simply a person with <strong>high self-esteem</strong> that
    is <strong>skilled at finding people with money and low self-esteem</strong>, insecurity being an incredibly profitable emotion</li>
<li><strong>shit-test</strong><ul>
<li>TODO</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>do they have alternatives?<ul>
<li>you can play to their ego by telling them if an inferior service is what they're after.</li>
<li>lightly offend anybody who considers their need or problem serious, and thus worth paying more to get a quality of service equal to the seriousness of their problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The discount</strong> if you're in a buyer's market</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If they pay up but cannot afford your services in the future, <strong>offer a tactical discount in
    an attempt to retain their business (say 10%)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not offer a steep discount as it damages the perception you provide an elite service</li>
<li>elite servies are not cheap services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>use the discount gambit to feed their ego</strong>, feeling warm, fuzzy and proud of themselves for the old customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only offer the discount if you're in a buyer's market</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opening offers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>agree to do sth for free</strong> and <strong>be owed a favor</strong> if the person you're dealing with is very powerful</p>
<ul>
<li>or give it to them cheaply so <strong>you can leverage your generosity later on</strong></li>
<li>when dealing with the powerful, it's better to be paid in favor rather than money,
    as their favor is more effective at getting you out of a tight spot than their money</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask for 3 times</strong> what you value yourself when they want you to make the first offer</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value yourself highly</strong><ul>
<li>they wanna see how much you value your services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>people like to offer you 50-75% of what you asked for to feel like they got a bargain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Maxims</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are surprised someone has made you a really great offer, <strong>do not let on</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Hide your excitement</strong>, <strong>act entitled</strong>, <strong>even slightly offended to see if you cannot squeeze the other party for a little more</strong></li>
<li>say like "Yes, I find this agreeable" sounds far more composed than "that's so awesome"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you feel you are taking more than you deserve<ul>
<li><strong>Hide your guilt</strong>, <strong>remain stern</strong>, <strong>but be friendly</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>you deserve it</strong>.</li>
</ul>
