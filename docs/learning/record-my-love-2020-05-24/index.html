<h4><strong>the art of love</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>所有幸福的夫妇都像好朋友一样生活。
在把你的伴侣当成配偶之前，<strong>先把对方当成最好的朋友</strong>; 这样，积极的看法就会压倒消极的看法。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>對婚姻的認識，凱勒牧師（Rev Tim Keller）建議：</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>在交友戀愛的時候，不要以物質條件為優先，
 而是「首先要<strong>尋求友誼</strong>，要找一個比你更了解你的人，一個<strong>能使你變得更美好的人</strong>，然後再看這種友誼能否發展成為愛情和婚姻」</p>
</li>
