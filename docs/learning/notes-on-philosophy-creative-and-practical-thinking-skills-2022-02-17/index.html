<ul>
<li>
<p>不要把假设和结论混为一谈; <strong>搜集证据,印证假设到导出真正结论过程中的逻辑思考</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>认清现象和原因的不同; <strong>很多都不是原因,而是现象(结果)</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>在许多个案中,真正的原因只有其中一个,而其他只是这个原因导致的现象  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>如果发现自己的假设是错的,重新做假设,再次出发就行了</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>一直悔恨自己的人生,与固执于错误的假设是一样没有意义的</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>在提出假设的阶段,真正的成败挑战才登场  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>解决问题的能力,就是为印证假设不辞辛苦的行动力</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>给出的建议中,只要有一个就足够了</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>逻辑思考的基础在于累积事实,如果呈现的是事实,就一定要虚心接受</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>当自己的意见和对方不同时,以秉持事实为证的信念</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>线性思考行不通; 科学的方法是<strong>问为什么,理由</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>真的是这样吗? 才是工作的开始,要听的是论点</strong>  </li>
<li>一个问题有数百个变量,且随时间而变化,所以答案不唯一; 要准确做出判断几乎不可能 ,但是<strong>以科学的方法思考,则可做整体的控制</strong>  </li>
<li>现在已进入像叶子不知会掉落何处的复杂体系中,几乎所有问题都没有答案  </li>
<li><strong>培养孩子养成动脑思考的习惯,让孩子对无解的问题设法提出假设,并不厌其烦努力证明自己的假设是否正确</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>世界上许多问题本来就没有答案; 那些<strong>忠于自己,能够找出属于自己的答案的人,其生命力比起已经习惯别人给出答案的人,一定更为强韧</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>就算没有答案,也会自己提出假设,反复求证,直到找出答案</strong>; 不管碰到任何困难,都勇于接受挑战,坚持到底,才是教育的根本    </li>
<li><strong>思考方式,重视的是如何才能导出结论</strong>,而不是有没有知识  </li>
<li><strong>以假设前提进行回答,有前提就有结论的思考模式</strong>; 对问题的前提先做个明确的假设,若前提错误,可以改变前提再回答  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>不太需要思考的事,尽量减少思考,且绝不没事自寻烦恼,生活要非常简单,把能规律化的事情规律化</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>训练自己常保持好奇心,和别人接触的机会增长见识</strong>  </li>
<li>做一些可以让自己生存下去的投资,<strong>请问你成长了多少</strong>   </li>
<li>最伤脑筋的是<strong>做什么事都半途而废的人</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>碰到自己没有遇到过的问题时,尝试解决</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>常常提出质疑,然后找出问题的解决方法</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>关于实证主义哲学和生活方式</h3>
<h4>从证实 到证伪</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>科学 - <strong>可证伪性</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>现在科学 从发现正确 到 <strong>修正假设，试错中 尽量接近对</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>科学是 <strong>不断探索未知，修正假设的过程中的一系列实践</strong>， 不是绝对正确的真理  </li>
<li>专家<strong>会搞错</strong>，但<strong>知道怎么根据专业知识不断调整认知，尽量接近对</strong>    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>现在正确的，将来都可能是错误的    </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>sicence needs to fail  </p>
<ul>
<li>To move forward, <strong>science needs to fail</strong>, which runs counter to our human desire for certainty    </li>
<li>
<p>rahter than give up, we struggle along a scale of process. 
The journey to <strong>understand more</strong> about the mysteries of the world and <strong>explain them with reason is the core of our nature</strong>    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science isn’t something to believe in, nor is it an absolute. 
It’s <strong>a cyclic process of evaluating and changing your mind based on new, better evidence and data</strong>  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>experienced or seen</strong> rather than theory</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>实证主义    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>经验归纳  -&gt; 用丰富的具象事物 来 验证 理论假设  </p>
<ul>
<li>一种信息是让你认识到<strong>更多的事实</strong>，另外一种信息是 <strong>加深你对世界的理解</strong>； 
<strong>探寻更广（非更多）的第一种信息是用来排出候选的第二种信息</strong>，而不是用来印证第二种信息；<br />
<strong>如果没有对具象事物足够的细节把握</strong>，抽象的思维方式很容易陷入自说自话，纸上谈兵的困境   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>发现一个新现象， 到依据这一新发现形成一个假设</strong>， 再到发送一个新探测器去检测这一假设  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>判例法  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>经验主义</strong>  - <strong>依靠感官认识世界， 再进行“归纳思维”</strong>， 不同于 理性主义  </p>
<ul>
<li>司法更加能动性  </li>
<li><strong>更能 “反馈” 以及适应社会动态</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>更 “稳定和延续性”</strong>， 更有助于确保商人的基本人权  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>普通法 向 成文法 靠拢 （成文法（议会的法律） 优于 普通法 （法院的规定）  </p>
<ul>
<li>在民主化的背景下 但保证法制  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>经验主义  -&gt; 实证主义的方法论 -&gt; <strong>实验科学</strong>  《= 归纳法， 而不是推理  </p>
<ul>
<li>从观察事件入手，<strong>从经验观察出发</strong>， 通过精确描述，推断出自然规律， 进而证实这些事件  </li>
<li>
<p>实证科学的可操作性  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>通过观察归纳建立一个理论后，在该理论基础上进行演绎推理，预测可能的现象； 然后通过实证检验为这个理论及其演绎寻找</strong>  -&gt; Bayesian  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>先有碎片而后不断构建框架</strong>  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>不断根据新的碎片 修正甚至打破旧的框架 并构建新的框架</strong>， 开始比较慢，但最终会后来居上 </p>
<ul>
<li>先有框架后有碎片，容易上手，开始会看上去遥遥领先，但后面就僵化而无法增长  </li>
<li>框架固化后 最大坏处 是容易偏执的去 “占小便宜吃大亏”， 因为已经成为本  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>当我们观察，了解这个世界的时候，<strong>一定要靠更多的事实，经验做基础</strong>，  而不是急于把它套在一个很大的理论框架，概念上  </p>
<ul>
<li>很多大的成败都不是可以简单归于一般性的原因，有很多具体的原因； <strong>很多细小的事情决定成败</strong>，后来的成功失败又重新塑造了人们对历史对社会对人生的看法  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>所有的决定都是微观的</strong>，是在具体的环境里面对具体问题做出的  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>observe -&gt; find patterns -&gt; create a short-cut framework -&gt; realize your framework sucks </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ask open-ended quesitons</strong>    </li>
<li>seeing some patterns in the answers  </li>
<li><strong>make a framework from these patterns</strong>. now I can make decisions quickly  </li>
<li>wait, this is a situation my framework does not account for  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>证伪主义</strong> -&gt; 科学的工作就是 通过寻找不符合理论的观察/实验 来对理论进行证伪  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>理性主义  </p>
<ul>
<li>理性推论而非经验观察提供最确实的理论知识体系  </li>
<li>知识仅仅存在于完美的独立世界； 我们感受的世界，是对完美知识世界的部分复制  </li>
<li>演绎推理  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>自由市場 vs 计划经济  </p>
<ul>
<li>自由市场 是<strong>动态均衡</strong>， 强调 <strong>事后纠正</strong>  </li>
<li>计划经济 事静态均衡， 强调 <strong>事前计划</strong>    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>道德  </p>
<ul>
<li>纳粹和社会主义者, 都<strong>将问题于答案之间的起因和细节全部忽略</strong>  </li>
<li>只由<strong>问题的现象直接跳跃到 道德的答案</strong>  <ul>
<li>将一切问题引向为道德层  </li>
<li>不需要你自己百分百干净（道德评判）， 只要看你说的<strong>是否有道理或是事实</strong>，无论你是否别有用心，否则再干净也不行  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intentions don't matter. Actions do.<ul>
<li>That's why being ethical is hard  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>cognitive vs emotional intelligence  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one cognitive factor is an analytical thinking style  - thinking  </p>
<ul>
<li>tend to act according to reason rather than intuition  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>emotional intelligence</strong> - feeling   </p>
<ul>
<li>easily discern the emotions and motives of others </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Empiricism</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>演化的保守主义</strong> - <strong>相信普通人的常识和习惯</strong>    </p>
<ul>
<li>抽象理念可能会出错，但常识就可靠的多，因为<strong>常识毕竟经过时间的考验</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>生活的经验，朴素的常识</strong> 比 抽象的真理更重要    <ul>
<li>“<strong>我从不让抽象的东西主宰自己</strong>” - 柏克  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>一方面<strong>直觉非常重要</strong>，可是另一方面又要<strong>及时吸取新的观念修正</strong>自己的直觉  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from John Locke, David Hume to Edmund Burke    </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>内在世界 创造 外在世界</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>mind create reality    </p>
<ul>
<li>我们大脑只能接受这个光谱：  苹果是红色的  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>我认为看到的世界</strong> 或 <strong>我认为看到的困境</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>困境跟我們如何去感知这个困境</strong>有直接关系； 它不是客观存在的，只不过是你认为而已  </li>
<li>走出困境一个很重要的一点 是 <strong>要有一个不同的眼光 去看这个困境</strong>  <ul>
<li>比如 他们不知道我的需求是什么， 我没有表达我的需求  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>如何无解的一个问题，虽然可能现在还无解，但如果我知道规律是这样的话，<strong>如果我能从更高的角度上去看它</strong>，<strong>它就不一样</strong>    </p>
<ul>
<li>"No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it"  - Albert Einstein    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>when you communicate with another person, <strong>you're exploring the depths of your own consciousness</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the essence of love is <strong>the decision to connect</strong> or not  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the purpose of each relationship is to <strong>teach you how to love yourself from the inside out</strong>    </p>
<ul>
<li>when you learn to love everyone and everything, you come into align with your true self  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
