<ul>
<li>
<p>Use <strong>creativity</strong> to solve problems    </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>invest your creativity, skills and efforts into solve big problems</strong> and want free markets pay for it    </li>
<li>If the work doesn't require <strong>creativity</strong>, <strong>delegate it, automate it or leave it</strong>    </li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Focus on the matters  </p>

<h5>How To Do difficult Things</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Difficult problems  </p>
<ul>
<li>problems that are not a function of raw work hours, but rather require dealing with <strong>ambiguity</strong>    </li>
<li>
<p>you have to <strong>put a lot of skill or thinking</strong> into it    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hard work is just a lot of human-hours  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effective strategies </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>reduce the cognitive costs of decision making</strong> to solve the problem through 
<strong>collapsing a high dim problem space</strong> into a low dim of hard work  </p>
<ul>
<li>focus on decisions where pretty much <strong>anything you can do works</strong>  </li>
<li>prioritize decisions that quickly <strong>lead to good outcomes</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>delegate to external sources</strong> of decision making  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>减少选择性  </p>
<ul>
<li>优先级选择  </li>
<li><strong>Part of optionality</strong> is being willing to make changes  </li>
<li>"One of the difficult things about making decisions is it reduces opportunity in the short term, but <strong>that's the only thing that really creates great opportunity in the long term</strong>. If you don't make decisions, you try to <strong>live too much in a liminal opportunity space</strong>, you <strong>might be just missing very big opportunities</strong> and not creating what the really big opportunities are" </li>

<h5><strong>Check -   Constantly ask yourself what you're trying to do</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Always pick the simplest solution</strong> that solves your immediate problem, then <strong>change it when it is needed</strong>    </p>
<ul>
<li>keep is agile and adaptable; iterate faster  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constantly ask yourself what's the problem</strong> you're trying to solve  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After we implement the simple solution, we <strong>have a much better understanding of our problem</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be sure that <strong>you understand the problem deeply</strong>, and that you <strong>at least have an idea</strong> of how would you know that the problem is solved  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect Goals to a purpose   </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>propose a course of action</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>start small and start now  </li>
<li>write down your potential obstacles, execuses, or fears, as well as how you will navigate them  </li>
<li>celebrate your wins on each step  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>remind yourself: what I was trying to do ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask the question: does doing this solve my problem?  </p>
<ul>
<li>doing this should transform your problem into your imaginary solved problem </li>
<li>it's important to have an idea of how does the solved problem looks like  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do I need to do this?  </p>
<ul>
<li>All actions should be needed for solving the problem  </li>
<li>Any action that is not obviously needed, should be discarded  </li>
