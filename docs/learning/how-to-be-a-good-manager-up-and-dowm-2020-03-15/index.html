<p>show your thought process</p>
<ul>
<li>"<strong>I recommend</strong> this because X. <strong>My criteria/assumptions</strong> were A and B.
    The potential trade-off is Y, but seems manageable because Z. I vetted a range of options [options] and found [my recommendation] best fits our needs. "</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>offer solutions and flag issues</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4>treat your manager as a <strong>coach</strong>, not as a judge</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>主动向老板寻求反馈</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>主动问问上司</strong>，你的哪些工作令他们印象深刻，还有哪些方面需要改进</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>定期要求与之会面，<strong>定期了解他对你的看法</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>把重点放在应该完成哪些目标上， <strong>更好地了解管理层对自己的期望</strong>，不仅涉及日常工作，还包括长期思维</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>自己的事情主动跟进，有什么问题就跟老板说，讨论， 如果不是自己管辖范围内的事情，别人开心就好
    这里最重要的是你对你提出的问题已经找到合适的解决方案。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes your job to help the entreprenuer <strong>find a reasonable solution</strong> which is merely hard and <strong>gets most of what they wanted</strong>. A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.</p>

<h3>how to mange down</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>管理 - 激励员工</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>理解员工</p>
<ul>
<li>以员工的诉求为核心</li>
<li>在员工内心深处，不仅<strong>关心赚钱谋生</strong>，还<strong>更希望被人尊重，能体现自己的价值</strong>，能实在地体验完成工作后的卓越感</li>
<li>每一位员工都有理想追求，<strong>都想实现自我价值</strong>，并在一些领域有所建树</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>激励的终点，是让员工自我驱动</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>用激励</strong>取代控制，让员工实现自我驱动</p>
<ul>
<li>很强的控制欲</li>
<li>授权，支持，帮助</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>激励 是发自内心的鼓舞，认可员工价值</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>情境管理</strong> 而非控制</p>
<ul>
<li>在员工日常决策中，領導不會替你做决定，他们会<strong>利用自身信息与经验，帮你设定场景</strong></li>
<li>只要<strong>按场景假设</strong>，感觉自己的决定符合公司利益，就可以放手去干，不用非要按领导意思来</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself,even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>your role is to <strong>improve the purpose, people, and process of your team</strong> to <strong>get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcomes</strong> as you can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Giving Feedback - in a way that was helpful and direct, but also kind and thoughtful</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ask first</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>so that the person can be mentally prepared for it ahead of time</li>
<li>"Would you like to hear a suggestion?"</li>
<li>
<p>"Do u mind if I give you feedback?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or start off by asking them "How do u think it went? what do u think was good, what could we improve"</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>compliment + criticism + compliment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"The work you ... good; " + "However, ..., it might be better"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>be timely</p>
<ul>
<li>feedback is more effective when it is at the time of the event</li>
<li>If too much time has elasped, use judgement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make it about the task, not the person</p>
<ul>
<li>like <strong>"Adding headers to the email would make it easier to read"</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Give suggestions</strong> on how to improve</p>
<ul>
<li>tell them how - <strong>give them examples and ideas</strong> on how to make something better</li>
<li>more actionable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a personal example</p>
<ul>
<li>easier to receive is to make the recipient feel like they are not the only one making the mistake</li>
<li><strong>"I learned this the hard way"</strong> or "<strong>I used to do the same thing</strong>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide people <strong>the "why"</strong> behind your suggestions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the person to defend/vent/explain</p>
<ul>
<li>the receiving party may react by defending or justifying their approach</li>
<li>if that, <strong>just listen and allow them</strong> to say their piece</li>
<li>more ofthen than not they will still make the changes, but <strong>knowing that you heard their side of things will make them feel better</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>把事情的前因后果说清楚</strong>， 同时明确告知需要执行的事项</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Help them come up with a plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>have them draft up a plan</strong> and bring it back to you</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead them to figure it out</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lead them down your steps or your thought process on how you would solve the problem, not just give them the solution</li>

<li>"What have you considered trying"</li>
<li>"What did you research? Did you find anything?"</li>
<li>"And then finally, have you tried looking up ..."" (you would look for to find the answer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>start small</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>start with something that is easy to do</li>
