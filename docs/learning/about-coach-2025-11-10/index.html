<h4>Coach as a leader</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don't need to have all the solutions</p>
<ul>
<li>You do need to be able to <strong>connect with people</strong>, to <strong>inspire them to do their best</strong>,
    and to <strong>help them search inside</strong> and <strong>discover their own answers</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's unrealistic and ill-advised to expect leaders to have all the answers</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By using coaching</strong>, leaders can still be effective without knowing all the answewrs
    and without telling employees what to do</li>
<li>Coaching is about <strong>connecting with people</strong>, <strong>inspiring them to do their best</strong>, and <strong>helping them to grow</strong><ul>
<li>Coaching is also about <strong>challenging people to come up with the answers they require on their own</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking open-ended questions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>init "so, <strong>where would you like to start</strong>?"</p>
<ul>
<li>may well set some limits to the conversation</li>
<li>"<strong>I'm not prepared to talk about</strong> the budget today"</li>
<li>"<strong>I'd like to discuss</strong> last week's meeting, in addition to what's on your list"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify different modes of inquiry</p>
<ul>
<li>diagnostic inquiry<ul>
<li>focusing the other person's <strong>attention</strong> on specific aspects of their story,
    such as <strong>feelings and reactions</strong>, <strong>underlying causes or motives</strong>, or <strong>actions taken or contemplated</strong></li>
<li>"You seem frustrated with Chris. <strong>How's that relationship going</strong>?"</li>
<li>"It sounds like there's been some tension on your team. <strong>What do you think is happening</strong>?"</li>
<li>"That's an ambitious goal for that project. <strong>How are you planning to get there</strong>?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confrontational inquiry<ul>
<li>Challenge aspects of their story by <strong>introducting new ideas and hypotheses</strong></li>
<li>"You've been talking about Chris's shortcomings. <strong>How might you be contributing to</strong> the problem?"</li>
<li>"That's an exciting plan, but it has a lot of moving parts. <strong>What happens if</strong> you're behind schedule?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen</p>
<ul>
<li>make the other person truly feel heard<ul>
<li>eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, tics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empathize</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Empathy is the ability not only to comprehend <strong>another person's point of view</strong>,
    but also to vicariously <strong>experience their emotions</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feeling and expressing empathy</strong> is critical to helping the other person defuse their embarrassment</p>
<ul>
<li>shame - the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that <strong>we are flawed</strong> and <strong>therefore unworthy of love and belonging</strong></li>
<li>when employees need your help they are likely <strong>experiencing some form of shame</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>traps when trying to express empathy</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>compare our issues to theirs</strong> (my problem's worse)</li>
<li>try to be <strong>overly positive</strong> (look on the bright side)</li>
<li><strong>leap to problem-solving while ignoring what they're feeling</strong> in the moment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>expressing empathy need not prevent you from holding people to high standards</p>
<ul>
<li>After you've acknowledged an employee's <strong>struggles and feelings</strong>,
    they're <strong>more likely to respond to your efforts</strong> to motivate improved performace</li>

<h4>Shame &amp; Empathy</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>connection</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>forge meaningful authentic relationships</strong> with other people</li>
<li><strong>connection</strong> is what breathes lives and gives meaning to our lives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerability</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong>, willing to <strong>share not only our strengths</strong> with people, but <strong>our struggles</strong>
    that moves us towards empathy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empathy</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empathy</strong> is about being vulnerable with people in their vulnerability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shame</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shame is the feeling that we are fundamentally flawed or unworthy</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shame is <strong>a belief that we are the problem</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shame</strong> breeds fear, blame, and disconnection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear arises as a protective resposne to that shame</p>
<ul>
<li>We fear being seen, judged, or cast out because shame tells us we're not good enough</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fear of vulnerability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shame makes openness feel dangerous.
    Vulnerability could lead to more shame, so we fear being emotionally honest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build empathy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set boundaries<ul>
<li>openness doesn't mean oversharing.
    You can <strong>be authentic while protecting your emotional space</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sharing with trusted people</strong> can dissolve shame</li>
<li>Remind yourself that <strong>imperfection is human</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear of judgment</p>
<ul>
<li>Shame convinces us we'll be <strong>criticized</strong> or humiliated, so we fear situations where we might be evaluated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fear of failure</p>
<ul>
<li>Shame links failure to <strong>personal inadequacy</strong>, making us afraid to try, risk, or grow</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The awareness of human separation, <strong>without reunion by love</strong> - is the source of shame</p>
<ul>
<li>It is at the same time the source of <strong>guilt and anxiety</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I tell these stories which is the only way
    that we get out from underneath shame?</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't let you see these pieces of me
    because I fear that it will cause disconnection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>courage, compassion &amp; connection</p>
<ul>
<li>courage meant to speak your mind with your heart to tell your story</li>
<li>how do I stay open and sit in that with you as opposed to moving into blame if you share your story with me?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
