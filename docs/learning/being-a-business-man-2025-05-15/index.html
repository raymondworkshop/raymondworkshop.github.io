<li>keep overhead as light as possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the wings: products and services</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>everything you sell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sell the products that are <strong>profitable</strong> and <strong>in demand</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the engine: Marketing</p>
<ul>
<li>a marketing budget</li>

<h4>negotiation - Trust a proven process</h4>

<li>
<p><strong>Always know whether you are in a competitive or collaborative</strong> negotiation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Know <strong>what kind of negotiation mode the person</strong> you are negotiating with is in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A competitive negotiator <strong>will not stop until they are sure you have lost</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>they aren't interested in understanding what I wanted, <strong>only in getting what they wanted</strong></li>
<li>creating a false bottom to the negotiation</li>
<li>make sure to <strong>let them know you won't be able to go any further</strong> and that's when they will feel as though they have won</li>
<li>I let them know this was a lot of money and I would have to <strong>make a significant sacrifice to make it happen</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>find out if there is anything <strong>you can offer your counterpart as a way of making the deal more satisfying</strong> and bringing it to a close</p>
<ul>
<li>understand that a negotiation is about <strong>more than just numbers</strong>;
    it's about <strong>bringing somebody satisfaction</strong> at the end of the deal<ul>
<li><strong>list "other benefits"</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ask yourself <strong>what other factors could be in play</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>make the opening offer on the table for</strong> the rest of the conversation</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>having information</strong> that adjusts the gravity of the negotiation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversify your interest in an opportunity before you start negotiating</strong> to avoid being emotionally hooked</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>split your interest</strong>, you <strong>gain leveraging power</strong> and also realize a scarcity mindset could cost you</li>
</ul>
