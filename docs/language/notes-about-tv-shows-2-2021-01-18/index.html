Hmm, <strong>I don't know</strong>. <strong>Maybe we could try</strong> another light color.<br />
Yeah, <strong>we could try that</strong>.<br />
Ok.<br />
</p>
<p>Here's a spreadsheet I made.<br />
<strong>Thank you</strong> <strong>but I'm finding it</strong> a little difficult to understand.<br />
ho, <strong>I see</strong>. <strong>what's the problem</strong>?<br />
<strong>I feel like maybe</strong> the columns could be clearer.<br />
Okay. <strong>Do you have any ideas about what I could try</strong> to improve it?<br />
<strong>Maybe you could try</strong> adding a column with headings.<br />
Okay, I'll try that.<br />
<strong>Thank you</strong>. <strong>Don't worry if it's too much effort</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you could</strong> finish that document soon?<br />
I can't right now but I can do it later today.<br />
Okay. <strong>I don't suppose you could</strong> do it a bit sooner, could you?<br />
<strong>Not really. Sorry</strong>, I'm a bit tied up at the moment.<br />
Okay, <strong>don't worry</strong>. <strong>Let me know when you're free</strong>.<br />

<strong>I think you're supposed to</strong> wash the leaves first,
<strong>but I'm sure it doesn't matter</strong> too much.<br />
oh whoops, <strong>I guess</strong> I forgot to do that.<br />
<strong>Don't worry</strong>. <strong>I'm sure it's fine</strong>.<br />
I hope so.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you could</strong> write the draft for this next article? <br />
Hmm, <strong>I'd prefer</strong> if someone else could do it <strong>if possible</strong> <strong>as it's not my field</strong>.<br />
<strong>It would be great if you could</strong> do it because Judy's on holiday.<br />
Okay, I'll have a go.<br />
Thank you so much.<br />
No worries.  </p>

Listen, it's completely <strong>freaking him out</strong> (吓坏了).<br />
</p>
<p>No, I'm serious. You need to <strong>find out where she is</strong> (知道她的感觉)<br />
Because if <strong>she's not where you are</strong> (不喜欢你), then you can start to <strong>move past this</strong> (你可以放下).  If she is <strong>where you are</strong> (喜欢你), then my feeling weird shouldn't <strong>stand in the way</strong> (妨碍你们).<br />
