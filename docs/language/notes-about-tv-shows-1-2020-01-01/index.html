<p>Come on, would you just think about it?  ( 考虑一下)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to be with you. I don't know, <strong>I feel like lately you're slipping away from me. I know it's dumb</strong>, but i just hate that I'm not a part of it.</p>

<p>Can u give us a minute ?</p>
<p>How do u feel?</p>
<p>Is there a problem?</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>I was nice to spend some quality hours with you, gramps.</p>
<p>And how, may i ask, is uncle logan doing?  (怎么样了)</p>
<h4>SO3E10</h4>
<p>I don't mind <strong>paying my dues</strong> (不介意吃苦)</p>
<p>Is my misery <strong>amusing to</strong> you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you want my pickle?  (想吃我的泡菜么)</p>
<p>I didn't have to, because I was wearing my "I heart Ross" sandwich board and ringing my bell.  (我穿着 ..., 一直摇铃铛)</p>

<h4>S03E08</h4>
<p>Monica and I <strong>aren't supposed to</strong> play football. (have to)</p>
<p>It was so not an accident.</p>
<h4>S03E07</h4>
<p>So <strong>what's matter</strong>? You need a dentist?  I've got a good one.</p>
<p>Can I get a <strong>napkin</strong> too?  (纸巾)</p>
<p><strong>No, he's not</strong>.</p>
<p>So <strong>what are you gonna do</strong>? <strong>How are you gonna tell</strong> Chandler?</p>
<p><strong>That's what i was gonna ask</strong>. thank you.</p>
<p>Anything you want to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>No offense</strong> (没有恶意), but <strong>I've always thought of</strong> Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.</p>
<p>Janice, <strong>I have something I need to tell you</strong>. <strong>And I want you to let me get through it</strong>.  (讲完) because it's not gonna be easy.</p>
<h4>Modern love s104</h4>
<p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>You have somtghing to <strong>string together</strong> there. (组织归纳)</p>
<p><strong>I was asking if</strong> ...</p>
<p>we're <strong>running like another five minutes late</strong> (再晚5分钟). we are so sorry.</p>
<p>I'll try to <strong>hurry them along</strong>.  (催快点)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>thank you for that information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like that you did that.
Of course, it does put you at a bit of a disadvantage now in terms of getting the job.</p>
<p>It's important to <strong>represent who you are</strong> at these things.</p>
<p>I don't need an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>The question is: what don't we do?</p>
<p>So <strong>I wonder how they met</strong>.</p>
<p>Just fascinating to me. what that initial spark is, you know?</p>
<p>So <strong>then why don't you ask him</strong>, why you would ask your, ur, customers?</p>
<p>Do u have any preference?</p>
<p>Any yet love is so universal.
We understand so little about animals, except that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, are you okay?</p>
<p>Hey, what's up?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I threw myself into work. (埋头工作)</p>
<p>The statistics I was reading about contradicted ...</p>
<h4>Modern love s105</h4>
<p>You know when you move into a place and you visualize this whole new amazing life for yourself?</p>
<p>Can we just forget that that happened ?</p>
<p>I really had no expectation that this would happend tonight.</p>
<p>I'll make sure he does.</p>
<p>you'd stay if the roles were reversed.</p>
<p>It got the quality of slightly decadent espionage, people always <strong>associate me with</strong></p>
<p>For me, it's paralyzing. and so I have no bandwidth left for actual experience.
Does it make sense?</p>
<p>People are so <strong>concerned to put on</strong> (努力展示) this big front normally, but now you've seen me my most vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm sorry
What's that cause of death?
was he sick for long?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Modern love season 1</h4>
<p>Plus, if you <strong>strike out</strong> (不成功), you don't have to skulk off into the night, empty-handed like a total loser</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so, where we going?
Anywhere. With you.
I mean, you just, totally <strong>brightened up</strong> my day.
You just don't let stuff like that <strong>pass you by</strong> in life. (溜走)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't matter how good you are at your job.
<strong>I just can't defend anyone</strong> missing days like that to our bosses</p>
<p>It's not getting off to a great start.  (开头不太顺利)</p>
<p>you shouldn't <strong>feel obliged to do</strong> this. (强迫)</p>
<h4>S03E06</h4>
<p>Wow, <strong>it's like a dirty math problem</strong>.</p>
<p>you guys do has never <strong>bumped uglies</strong> (丑闻).</p>
<p>Well, listen. I still have one more person to meet. But unless it turns out to be your sister.  I think your chances are pretty good.</p>
<p>wanna hear <strong>something that sucks</strong>? ( 烂事)</p>
<p>Just like you always wanted. congratulations.</p>
<p>so i think I'll get back to my friends.</p>
<p>Do u want to come in for some lemonade?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a great place.

<p>Sorry, I thought You liked me. I'm such a jerk.

<p>you okay?

Come here. Listen, you are one of my favorite people, and the most beautiful woman I
've ever known in real life</p>

I mean it. This feels really good. is it 100% cotton?

Anyway, I should go. <strong>one of the lfieguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.</strong>

<h4>SO3E05</h4>
<p>You're so sweet to wait with me.</p>
<p>I just wonder if I could ...</p>
<p>well, that kind of thing requires some serious thought.</p>
<p>You know, we really don't take advantage of living in the city. (白住了)</p>
<p>I hightly doubt that.</p>
<p>You should just leave it.</p>
<p>I was wondering if i could maybe buy you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>we have an understanding. (共识)</p>
<p>I just <strong>bumped you for that guy</strong> over there.  (取代你)</p>
<h4>S03E04</h4>
<p><strong>what a sad little life she must lead</strong>. (圈子真小的)</p>
<p>Face the fear</p>
<p>I've scared you.(吓着你了)  I've said too much.</p>
<p>I didn't recognize you in those pant.</p>
<p>I've actually <strong>ruined</strong> this, haven't it?  (搞砸了)</p>
<p>I'm so glad that you called. I know I've been acting really weird lately.
and it's just because I'm crazy about you. and i just got stupid and scared, really?</p>
<p>I love you too.</p>
<h4>S03E02</h4>
<p>am i in it?</p>
<p>I'll sing a song <strong>about the wonder</strong> that is joey. (歌颂joey的伟大)</p>
<p>You look great.</p>
<p>I don't know. You might be the first one.</p>
<p>I <strong>went through</strong> (经历) the same thing. And you know what i did? I got dressed.</p>
<p>"Hi, it's Monica. <strong>I'm just checking in cause</strong> I got this message from you. So let me know."</p>
<p>"hello, it's me. Yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend. okay?"</p>
<p>The cushions're the <strong>essence</strong> of the chair. (精华)</p>
<p>I would like <strong>back</strong> one of these days. (回避)</p>
<p>I'm sorry. we <strong>didn't mean</strong> it. (不是故意)</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity ...</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I want you there. I need you there.
Look. <strong>what can i do to show you</strong> how much you mean to me?</p>
<p><strong>I was quite impressed with</strong> your paper on ...</p>
<h4>S02E24</h4>
<p>cause he was just so <strong>darn</strong> cute. (强调)</p>
<p>Mr. Beatty <strong>comes up to me</strong> and says  ... (过来**</p>
<p><strong>Who cares what that guy thinks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>looking like something</strong> you drink when your nauseous. (像)</p>
<p><strong>I wonder</strong> what our wedding's gonna be like.</p>
<p>so they can tell <strong>grown ups</strong> (大人) to <strong>cut it out</strong> (够了).</p>
<p><strong>Hey, you know i got a question for you, Just a little thing, no pressure.</strong></p>
<p>Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
yes, am i int it?</p>
<p>keep talking</p>
<p><strong>Do u see</strong> kids in our future?</p>
<p>She didn't love him, which <strong>incidentally worked out pretty well</strong> for me. (顺带成全我)</p>
<p>See u in the parking lot.</p>
<p>If kids is <strong>what I takes to be with you</strong> then kids it is .
If i have to all, I'll do all again.</p>
<p><strong>I don't wanna lose you</strong>, so if I have to do it all over again, then i will.</p>

<p>Just let it sink in how lucky you are.</p>
<p>You, uh, want to go for a hike?  They ahve some beautiful trails around the lake.</p>
<p>Here you're <strong>at their mercy</strong>, I guess. (被摆布)</p>
<p>It's not for me. (我没兴趣)</p>
<p><strong>because your consciousness can think and comapre with your memories. That's still you.</strong></p>
<p>thinking and being alive.</p>
<p>i mean, maybe the imperfections make it more like life.  cause life isn't perfect.
Life is  the most magical gift there is.</p>
<h4>S02E23</h4>
<p>it is so ironic <strong>considering</strong> i'm a vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>Was I supposed to</strong> bring something too? (我是不是也该带点什么)</p>
<p>You know, <strong>I like the way you have</strong> effieicently</p>
<p>well, I am confuese. I thought we shared time.</p>
