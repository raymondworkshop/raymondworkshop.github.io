<p>And how, may i ask, is uncle logan doing?  (怎么样了)</p>
<h4>SO3E10</h4>
<p>I don't mind <strong>paying my dues</strong> (不介意吃苦)</p>
<p>Is my misery <strong>amusing to</strong> you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you want my pickle?  (想吃我的泡菜么)</p>
<p>I didn't have to, because I was wearing my &quot;I heart Ross&quot; sandwich board and ringing my bell.  (我穿着 ..., 一直摇铃铛)</p>

<h4>S03E08</h4>
<p>Monica and I <strong>aren't supposed to</strong> play football. (have to)</p>
<p>It was so not an accident.</p>
<h4>S03E07</h4>

<p>Can I get a <strong>napkin</strong> too?  (纸巾)</p>

<h4>Modern love s104</h4>

<p>I'll try to <strong>hurry them along</strong>.  (催快点)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>thank you for that information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like that you did that.
Of course, it does put you at a bit of a disadvantage now in terms of getting the job.</p>
<p>It's important to <strong>represent who you are</strong> at these things.</p>
<p>I don't need an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>The question is: what don't we do?</p>
<p>So <strong>I wonder how they met</strong>.</p>
<p>Just fascinating to me. what that initial spark is, you know?</p>
<p>So <strong>then why don't you ask him</strong>, why you would ask your, ur, customers?</p>
<p>Do u have any preference?</p>
<p>Any yet love is so universal.
We understand so little about animals, except that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, are you okay?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, what's up?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>

<p>You know when you move into a place and you visualize this whole new amazing life for yourself?</p>
<p>Can we just forget that that happened ?</p>
<p>I really had no expectation that this would happend tonight.</p>
<p>I'll make sure he does.</p>
<p>you'd stay if the roles were reversed.</p>
<p>It got the quality of slightly decadent espionage, people always <strong>associate me with</strong></p>
<p>For me, it's paralyzing. and so I have no bandwidth left for actual experience.
Does it make sense?</p>
<p>People are so <strong>concerned to put on</strong> (努力展示) this big front normally, but now you've seen me my most vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm sorry
What's that cause of death?
was he sick for long?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Modern love season 1</h4>
<p>Plus, if you <strong>strike out</strong> (不成功), you don't have to skulk off into the night, empty-handed like a total loser</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so, where we going?
Anywhere. With you.
I mean, you just, totally <strong>brightened up</strong> my day.
You just don't let stuff like that <strong>pass you by</strong> in life. (溜走)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't matter how good you are at your job.
<strong>I just can't defend anyone</strong> missing days like that to our bosses</p>
<p>It's not getting off to a great start.  (开头不太顺利)</p>
<p>you shouldn't <strong>feel obliged to do</strong> this. (强迫)</p>
<h4>S03E06</h4>
<p>Wow, <strong>it's like a dirty math problem</strong>.</p>

<h4>SO3E05</h4>
<p>You're so sweet to wait with me.</p>
<p>I just wonder if I could ...</p>
<p>well, that kind of thing requires some serious thought.</p>
<p>You know, we really don't take advantage of living in the city. (白住了)</p>
<p>I hightly doubt that.</p>
<p>You should just leave it.</p>
<p>I was wondering if i could maybe buy you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>we have an understanding. (共识)</p>
<p>I just <strong>bumped you for that guy</strong> over there.  (取代你)</p>

<p>I'm sorry. we <strong>didn't mean</strong> it. (不是故意)</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity ...</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I want you there. I need you there.
Look. <strong>what can i do to show you</strong> how much you mean to me?</p>
<p><strong>I was quite impressed with</strong> your paper on ...</p>
<h4>S02E24</h4>
<p>cause he was just so <strong>darn</strong> cute. (强调)</p>
<p>Mr. Beatty <strong>comes up to me</strong> and says  ... (过来**</p>
<p><strong>Who cares what that guy thinks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>looking like something</strong> you drink when your nauseous. (像)</p>
<p><strong>I wonder</strong> what our wedding's gonna be like.</p>
<p>so they can tell <strong>grown ups</strong> (大人) to <strong>cut it out</strong> (够了).</p>
<p><strong>Hey, you know i got a question for you, Just a little thing, no pressure.</strong></p>
<p>Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?

<p>Here you're <strong>at their mercy</strong>, I guess. (被摆布)</p>
<p>It's not for me. (我没兴趣)</p>
<p><strong>because your consciousness can think and comapre with your memories. That's still you.</strong></p>
<p>thinking and being alive.</p>
<p>i mean, maybe the imperfections make it more like life.  cause life isn't perfect.
Life is  the most magical gift there is.</p>
