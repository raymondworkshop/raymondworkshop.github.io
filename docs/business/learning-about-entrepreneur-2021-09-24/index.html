<h4><strong>How to get Rich</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Wealth is assets and business that can earn</strong> while you sleep  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the purpose of wealth is <strong>freedom</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ethical wealth creation makes abundance for everybody</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>it's <strong>a positive sum game</strong> but <strong>there are competitive elements</strong> to it  </li>
<li>the modern industrial economies are much more heavily wealth-based societies  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall capitalism (Free markets) are <strong>intrinsic to the human species</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>the notion of <strong>exchange</strong>, and <strong>keeping track of credits and debits</strong> is built to us as flexible social animals    </li>
<li>
<p><strong>keeping track of credits and debits</strong> lets us <strong>cooperate</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>who put in how much work?  </li>
<li>who contributed how much?  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capitalism is actually good</p>
<ul>
<li>it gets hijacked by <strong>improper yields</strong>, where you have <strong>corruption</strong>, or you have <strong>monopolies</strong>  </li>
<li>商人被污名化 - 官商 - （垄断+腐败）   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money is how we transfer wealth  </p>
<ul>
<li>money is <strong>social credits</strong>; it's <strong>the ability to have credits and debits of other poeple's time</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Status is your rank in the <strong>social hierarchy</strong>         </p>
<ul>
<li>stauts is a zero-sum game; to win you have to put somebody else down   </li>
<li>politics is an example of a status game  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You won't get rich renting out your time</strong>    </p>
<ul>
<li>you can't earn <strong>non-linearly</strong>  <ul>
<li>your inputs are matched to your outputs  </li>
<li>you are replaceable because you're now <strong>doing a set role</strong>    <ul>
<li>you're not being creative   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>they're just <strong>not gonna pay you enough</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>they pay you the bare min that thay have to, to get you to do their job   </li>
<li>they take on the risk, the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must <strong>own equity</strong> to gain your financial freedom  </p>
<ul>
<li>the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want <strong>a career where your inputs don't match your outputs</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tools and leverage</strong> are what create the disconnection between inputs and outputs  <ul>
<li>look for <strong>things</strong> that are leveraged  </li>
<li>the higher the <strong>creativity component</strong> of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideally, <strong>make your money in discrete lumps</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>your own lifestyle does not have a chance to adapt quickly  </li>
<li>have much more creative expression, and much less about money  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will get rich by <strong>giving society what it wants,but doesn't yet know how to get at scale</strong>      </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Society always wants new things</strong>, and society will pay you for creating things that it wants  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>But society doesn't yet know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn't nee you  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>figure out <strong>what you can provide</strong>, figure out <strong>how to build that</strong>, and then they figured out <strong>how to scale it</strong>  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Play longterm games with longterm people</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>all the benefits in life come from <strong>compound interests</strong>  </li>
<li>
<p>in a longterm game, it's <strong>positive sum</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>high trust will make it easier to play the game  </li>
<li>important to pick an industry/city where you can play long-term games, and with long-term people  </li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>get traction, and never fall back  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Pick partners with <strong>high intelligence, energy and integrity</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li>some who is smart <strong>at that thing</strong>  </li>

<li>delegation - someone <strong>wants to do what you want them to do</strong>    </li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Partner with <strong>rational optimists</strong>  </p>

<li>
<p>you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have an <strong>action bias</strong> towards getting what you want  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>just do things</strong>  <ul>
<li>figure out if sth is viable or not by <strong>doing it</strong>  </li>
<li>at least do the first step, and the second step, and <strong>then decide</strong>    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Either lead, follow, or get out of the way</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't partner with pessimists and cynics  </p>
<ul>
<li>modern society is far, far <strong>safer</strong>  </li>
<li>their beliefs are self-fulfilling  </li>
<li>they just wanna tell you why the thing is not going to work  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arm Yourself with Specific Knowledge  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specific Knowledge is <strong>the knowledge that you care about</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>specific knowledge is found more by pursuing your innate talents,
your genuine curiosity, and your passion  </li>
<li>
<p>your specific knowledge is often <strong>observed</strong> by other people <strong>who know you well and revealed in situations rahter</strong> than something that you come up with  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>look back on your own life and see what you're actually good at</strong>  </li>

<p>look at what you have already built by that point, and then <strong>you can build on top of it</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>follow your own obsession, and keep an eye out for the commercial aspects of it  </p>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>reading</strong> is the foundation for your self-education    </p>
<ul>
<li>you need creativity, you <strong>need the ability to feed your own brain to learn whatever you want</strong>    </li>
<li>
<p><strong>take your natural path</strong> and <strong>just read the things that interest you</strong> until you kind of understand them  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>read the original scientific books</strong> in a field  </p>
<ul>
<li>the foundations are Math and Logic  <ul>
<li>when you understand <strong>the scientific method</strong>, then you can understand how to separate truth from falsehood </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>you can absorb what is true, you can reject what is false, and <strong>you have a basis for even working that out that is logical and scientific</strong> and not purely just based on opinions  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>understanding that comes through repetition and through usage and through logic and foundations</strong> that really makes you a smart thinker  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>foucs on the foundations  </p>
<ul>
<li>basic concepts from game theory, psychology, ethics, math, computers, and logic will serve you much better  </li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>you can <strong>learn better by doing iterations</strong> on the job  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace Accountability</strong> to get leverage  </p>
<ul>
<li>accountability is results-focused  </li>
<li>
<p>build up <strong>credibility</strong> to get following labors and money  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in modern society, <strong>the downside risk is not that large</strong>    </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need <strong>specific knowledge and accountability</strong> and <strong>you have a good name</strong> in that domain      </p>
<ul>
<li>then people are going to give you capital as a form of leverage that you can use to then go get more capital  </li>
<li>Labor and Capital are old leverage  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>want the min amount of people working with you</strong> that are going to allow you to use the other forms of leverage  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capitcal as a leverage because it <strong>feels unfair</strong>, and nobody else around them or necessarily sharing in it  </p>

<p><strong>Principal-Agent Problem</strong>: Act like an owner  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A principal is an owner</strong>; an agent is an employee </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A principal's incentives are different than an agent's incentives  </p>
<ul>
<li>you have to <strong>get the incentives right to get people to behave correctly</strong>  <ul>
<li>almost all human behavior can <strong>be explained by incentives</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>People are much more honest with their actions</strong> than they are with their words  </li>
<li>the good ones are not just looking for <strong>money</strong>, they're also looking for <strong>things like status and meaning in what they do</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when you do deals, it's <strong>better to have the same incentives</strong>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Train yourself how to think like a principal</strong>  </p>

<li>think like the owner and act like the owner  </li>

<ul>
<li>it <strong>takes as much effort to create a small business as a large one</strong>  </li>
</ul>

<p>Don't <strong>bet everything on one big gamble</strong>    </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compounding Relationships</strong> make life easier  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turn short-term games into long-term games  </p>
<ul>
<li>Negotiation is about not wanting it too badly  </li>
<li>
<p>if someone is taking advantage of you in a negotiation, your best option is to <strong>turn it from a short-term game into a long-term game</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"i'm going to do this project with you, and I have three friends who want projects done who are waiting to see the outcome of this project."  </p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>relationships offer a good example of compound interest</strong>    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>mutual trust, you know that person's got your back  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it's better to <strong>have a few compounding relationships</strong> than many shallow ones  </p>

<ul>
<li>take on accountability and solve problems on the edge of knowledge that others can't solve, <strong>people will line up behind you</strong>. <strong>The leverage will come</strong>.  </li>
<li>"Hey, I'll take charge of this thing that nobody wants to take charge of"  </li>
</ul>
